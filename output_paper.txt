          Background:
        
      
      Immunotherapy has revolutionized skin cutaneous melanoma treatment, but response variability due to tumor heterogeneity necessitates robust biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy response.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), consensus clustering, and 10 machine learning algorithms to develop the immunotherapy-related gene model (ITRGM) signature. Multi-omics analyses included bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing of melanoma patients, mouse bulk RNA sequencing, and pathology sections of melanoma patients.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      We identified 66 consensus immunotherapy prognostic genes (CITPGs) using WGCNA and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from two melanoma cohorts. The CITPG-high group showed better prognosis and enriched immune activities. DEGs between CITPG-high and CITPG-low groups in the TCGA-SKCM cohort were analyzed in three additional melanoma cohorts using univariate Cox regression, resulting in 44 consensus genes. Using 101 machine learning algorithm combinations, we constructed the ITRGM signature based on seven model genes. The ITRGM outperformed 37 published signatures in predicting immunotherapy prognosis across the training cohort, three testing cohorts, and a meta-cohort. It effectively stratified patients into high-risk or low-risk groups for immunotherapy response. The low-risk group, with high levels of model genes, correlated with increased immune characteristics such as tumor mutation burden and immune cell infiltration, indicating immune-hot tumors with a better prognosis. The ITRGM's relationship with the tumor immune microenvironment was further validated in our experiments using pathology sections with GBP5, an important model gene, and CD8 IHC analysis. The ITRGM also predicted better immunotherapy response in eight cohorts, including urothelial carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma, indicating broad applicability.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      The ITRGM signature is a stable and robust predictor for stratifying melanoma patients into 'immune-hot' and 'immune-cold' tumors, enhancing prognosis and response to immunotherapy.

      Disulfidptosis, the newest form of programmed cell death, is closely associated with the immune microenvironment of cancer cells. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has also been found to play a crucial role in melanoma. However, the role of disulfidptosis-related lncRNA in melanoma remains unclear. Through bioinformatic analysis of the transcriptional, clinical, and pathological data from the TCGA-SKCM (The Cancer Genome Atlas-Skin cutaneous melanoma) database, we established a 2-Disulfidptosis-related lncRNA (DRL) prognostic model and a novel molecular subtype for melanoma. The survival and ROC curves of the 2-DRL prognostic model demonstrated its strong efficacy in predicting the prognosis of melanoma. The high-risk group of melanoma exhibited a significant decrease in ESTIMATEScore, ImmuneScore, and StromalScore, indicative of pronounced immune suppression and exhaustion. Subgroup C2 of melanoma displayed an immune-activated state, while subgroups C1 and C3 showed immune suppression and exhaustion, potentially leading to poorer prognosis. Subgroup C1 demonstrated better sensitivity to Zoledronate, UMI-77, Nilotinib, and Cytarabine. Subgroup C2 exhibited greater sensitivity to Ribociclib, XAV939, Topotecan, and Ruxolitinib. Subgroup C3 showed higher sensitivity to VX-11e, Ulixertinib, Trametinib, and Afatinib. This study revealed the immune microenvironment status and targeted drug sensitivity in melanoma patients with different risk scores and molecular subtypes, offering valuable guidance for clinical treatment and identifying significant DRL targets for future in-depth research.

      Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly fatal form of skin cancer that develops from the malignant transformation of epidermal melanocytes. There is substantial evidence linking autophagy to cancer etiology and immunotherapy efficacy. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) using TCGA datasets and further explore the potential function of critical ARGs in SKCM progression. We performed comprehensive bioinformatics analysis uses the TCGA dataset. RT-PCR was applied to examine the expression of CAPNS1 in SKCM cells. Lost-of-function experiments were performed to detect the expression of the related proteins. In this search, we screed 70 differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (DE-ARGs), including 33 up-DE-ARGs and 37 down-DE-ARGs. Enrichment assays revealed that these 70 DE-ARGs may exert influence on critical cellular processes such as autophagy, protein kinase activity, and signaling pathways, impacting cell growth, differentiation, survival, and tumor development. Then, we further explore the prognostic value of 70 DE-ARGs and confirmed 18 survival-related DE-ARGs in SKCM patients. Nearly all the 18 DE-ARGs' methylation was negatively correlated with their corresponding expression in SKCM. The 12 survival-related DE-ARGs were used to develop a unique predictive model that effectively classified SKCM patients into high- and low-risk groups with regard to overall survival. Furthermore, tumor environment analysis indicated that the risk score was associated with several immune cells. Among the 12 survival-related DE-ARGs, our attention focused on CAPNS1 which was highly expressed in SKCM patients and predicted a poor prognosis. In addition, we confirmed that knockdown of CAPNS1 distinctly suppressed the proliferation, metastasis and EMT of SKCM cells, and promoted autophagy via regulating Notch signaling pathway. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the intricate molecular landscape of SKCM progression and presents promising avenues for future research and clinical applications.

          Background:
        
      
      Cuproptosis, one of the most recently discovered forms of cell death, is induced by the disruption of copper binding to the mitochondrial respiratory acylation components. However, the mechanism underlying cuproptosis in uveal melanoma (UM) has not yet been adequately studied.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      RNA and clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Differentially expressed cuproptosis-related genes were identified by R software. A prognostic signature was constructed by applying LASSO regression and Cox regression models. The associations between the signature and the immune microenvironment, overall survival, and drug sensitivity were studied. In addition, qPCR and Western blotting were performed on UM cells and RPE cell lines to verify the expression levels of the genes encoding dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) and dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST) in UM cases.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Using a cuproptosis-related prognostic signature, UM samples were classified into high- and low-risk groups. A significant difference in overall survival between the two risk groups was evident. Receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated that the signature is a reliable predictor of prognosis. Immune cell infiltration, drug sensitivity, and immune checkpoint expression were analysed. Significant immune difference between the two high-risk groups was found, and the high expression of immune checkpoints in high-risk groups suggests significant immunotherapy potential. In addition, drug sensitivity analysis experiments suggest that erlotinib may be a potential treatment for high-risk patients. The results of in vitro experiments confirmed that DLD and DLST had higher expression levels in UM cell lines.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      The prognostic signature developed in this study is a reliable biomarker for predicting the prognosis of UM and may serve as a tool for personalised treatment of patients with UM.

      Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) plays a critical role in promoting tumor migration, invasion, and metastasis, partly by upregulating integrins. The molecular mechanisms behind how HGF facilitates integrin-mediated tumorigenesis are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) is essential for HGF-induced melanoma metastasis. HGF treatment dramatically increased the expression of both USP22 and multiple integrin family members in particular ITGAV, ITGB3, and ITGA1. An unbiased analysis of the TCGA database reveals integrins as common downstream targets of both USP22 and HGF across multiple human cancer types. Notably, CRISPR-mediated deletion of USP22 completely eliminates HGF-induced integrin expression in melanoma cells. At the molecular level, USP22 acts as a bona fide deubiquitinase for Sp1, a transcription factor for the ITGAV, ITGB3, and ITGA1 genes. USP22 interacts with and inhibits Sp1 ubiquitination, protecting against Sp1 proteasomal degradation. Supporting this, immunohistology analysis detects a positive correlation among USP22, Sp1, and integrin αv in human melanoma tissues. This study identifies the death from the signature gene USP22 as a critical positive regulator for HGF-induced integrin expression by deubiquitinating the Sp1 transcription factor during melanoma metastasis."

          Background:
        
      
      Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are related to the prognosis of cancer patients. Nevertheless, the potential prognostic values of NETs in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) remains largely unknown.

      The NET-related gene signature was constructed by LASSO Cox regression analysis using the TCGA-SKCM cohort. The overall survival (OS) and immune status in SKCM patients between the high- and low-NET score (high-score, low-score) groups were explored. The scRNA-seq dataset GSE115978 was used to understand the role of NET score in SKCM at single cell resolution.

      A five NET genes-based signature (TLR2, CLEC6A, PDE4B, SLC22A4 and CYP4F3) was constructed as the NET-related prognostic model for SKCM. The OS of SKCM patients with low-score was better than that in patients with high-score. Additionally, NET score was negatively associated with infiltration of some immune cells (e.g. type I Macrophages, CD8-T cells, CD4-T cells). Moreover, patients with high-score had low stromal, immune and ESTIMATE scores. Furthermore, drug sensitivity analysis results showed that Lapatinib, Trametinib and Erlotinib may have better therapeutic advantages in patients with high-score.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusion:
        
      
      We established a NET-related five gene signature in SKCM and found that the NET-related signature may exhibit a good predictive ability for SKCM prognosis. The NET score may not only predict the survival outcome and drug sensitivity in SKCM, but also reflect the immune conditions of SKCM patients.

      Despite studies highlighting the prognostic utility of DNA methylation in primary uveal melanoma (pUM), it has not been translated into a clinically useful tool. We sought to define a methylation signature to identify newly diagnosed individuals at high risk for developing metastasis. Methylation profiling was performed on 41 patients with pUM with stage T2-T4 and at least three years of follow-up using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip (N = 24) and the EPIC BeadChip (N = 17). Findings were validated in the TCGA cohort with known metastatic outcome (N = 69). Differentially methylated probes were identified in patients who developed metastasis. Unsupervised consensus clustering revealed three epigenomic subtypes associated with metastasis. To identify a prognostic signature, recursive feature elimination and random forest models were utilized within repeated cross-validation iterations. The 250 most commonly selected probes comprised the final signature, named MethylSig-UM. MethylSig-UM could distinguish individuals with pUM at diagnosis who develop future metastasis with an area under the curve of ~81% in the independent validation cohort, and remained significant in Cox proportional hazard models when combined with clinical features and established genomic biomarkers. Altered expression of immune-modulating genes were detected in MethylSig-UM positive tumors, providing clues for pUM resistance to immunotherapy. The MethylSig-UM model is available to enable additional validation in larger cohort sizes including T1 tumors.

      Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels function as cellular sensors with a broad impact, and their dysregulation is linked to numerous cancers. The influence of TRP channel-related long noncoding RNAs (TCRLs) on uveal melanoma (UM) remains poorly understood.

      We employed bioinformatics to examine the RNA-seq data and relevant clinical information of UM in the TCGA databases. By implementing coexpression analysis, we identified differentially expressed TCRLs. Using univariate Cox regression analysis, selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and stepwise regression, five key prognostic biomarkers were chosen. The high- and low-risk groups were divided based on the risk scores. Afterwards, the prediction performance of the signature was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis. The functional enrichment analysis of TCRLs was also investigated. Following that, we examined immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint expression, and tumor immune microenvironment between patients in high and low risk groups. TCRLs were validated using Random forests and multifactor Cox analysis. Candidate biomarkers were identified and screened. Finally, the effects of the candidate biomarkers on the proliferation, migration and invasion of UM cells were detected by CCK-8 assay, migration assay and perforation invasion assay.

      The risk score generated by five TCRLs demonstrated robust predictive power.

Furthermore, two TCRLs of risk score, AC092535.4 and LINC01637, were screened to multiplex modelling.

      Cutaneous melanoma, a malignancy of melanocytes, presents a significant challenge due to its aggressive nature and rising global incidence. Despite advancements in treatment, the variability in patient responses underscores the need for further research into novel therapeutic targets, including the role of programmed cell death pathways such as necroptosis. The melanoma datasets used for analysis, GSE215120, GSE19234, GSE22153 and GSE65904, were downloaded from the GEO database. The melanoma data from TCGA were downloaded from the UCSC website. Using single-cell sequencing, we assess the heterogeneity of necroptosis in cutaneous melanoma, identifying distinct cell clusters and necroptosis-related gene expression patterns. A combination of 101 machine learning algorithms was employed to construct a necroptosis-related signature (NRS) based on key genes associated with necroptosis. The prognostic value of NRS was evaluated in four cohorts (one TCGA and three GEO cohorts), and the tumour microenvironment (TME) was analysed to understand the relationship between necroptosis, tumour mutation burden (TMB) and immune infiltration. Finally, we focused on the role of key target TSPAN10 in the prognosis, pathogenesis, immunotherapy relevance and drug sensitivity of cutaneous melanoma. Our study revealed significant heterogeneity in necroptosis among melanoma cells, with a higher prevalence in epithelial cells, myeloid cells and fibroblasts. The NRS, developed through rigorous machine learning techniques, demonstrated robust prognostic capabilities, distinguishing high-risk patients with poorer outcomes in all cohorts. Analysis of the TME showed that high NRS scores correlated with lower TMB and reduced immune cell infiltration, indicating a potential mechanism through which necroptosis influences melanoma progression. Finally, TSPAN10 has been identified as a key target for cutaneous melanoma and is highly associated with poor prognosis. The findings highlight the complex role of necroptosis in cutaneous melanoma and introduce the NRS as a novel prognostic tool with potential to guide therapeutic decisions.

      The most common type of melanoma is cutaneous melanoma (CM). The predominant mutational signature is that of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular classification includes four major subtypes of CM based on common genetic alterations involving the following genes: BRAF, NRAS, and NF1, with a small fraction being \"triple\" wild-type. The two main signaling pathway abnormalities in CM are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Other less common types include mucosal melanomas (MM) and uveal melanoma (UM), which have a significantly different genomic landscape. Although few studies reported rare cases with HPV-positive (HPV+) melanoma, the clinicopathological and molecular characteristic of this entity has not been well-described. Among the 2084 melanoma cases queried at our institution, we identified seven patients diagnosed with HPV+ melanoma (prevalence 0.03 %), including five instances of CM and two of MM. The majority of cases were positive for HPV16 (n = 6). Most of the patients were elderly and with advanced disease (n = 6), although this finding may be attributed to the relative frequency of our institution testing advanced-stage tumors. Histologically, most cases showed high degree of pleomorphism and high mitotic count (5 or more mitoses/mm2) (n = 6). UVR signature was present in the CM, but not in the MM cases. Alterations in either MAPK and/or PI3K pathways were detected in the majority of cases (n = 6). The most common genetic abnormalities detected in this study occurred in the TERT promoter (TERTp) (n = 5), a finding that has been reported to be associated with aggressive disease. Our data shows that while HPV+ melanoma is rare, identifying this disease entity could help guide therapy given the demonstrated genomic alterations.

          Background:
        
      
      One popular and well-established marker for the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response is tumor mutation burden (TMB). Persistent TMB (pTMB), a subset of TMB, provides a better indicator to predict patient ICB therapy outcomes, as shown by some studies. Immune checkpoint drugs have significantly changed how melanoma is treated in recent years.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      In this study, we integrated the TCGA-SKCM database and data of pTMB of TCGA from the paper that first mentioned pTMB and analyzed mutational and Immune characteristics associated with pTMB level in SKCM. Next, the predictive DEGs were identified the subgroups of pTMB by Cox regression and LASSO analyses to construct a pTMB-related signature. Finally, the expression and Biological functions of signature genes was detected, and further validated in vitro assay.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      In the current research, we explored the mutational and immunological features related to the level of TMB in cutaneous melanoma (CM). The high-pTMB subgroup exhibited an increasing incidence of gene changes and higher levels of immune cell infiltration. Subsequently, we established a pTMB-related signature based on the predictive DEGs and found the biological features and immune-associated variables between two distinct risk groups. Lastly, the results of the clinical sample validation demonstrated that the expression of IL17REL was down-regulated in the collected samples of individuals with CM. The in vitro assay results indicated that IL17REL effectively suppressed the proliferation, clonality, and migration of CM cells.

      The prognosis for Cutaneous Melanoma (CM), a skin malignant tumor that is extremely aggressive, is not good. A recently identified type of controlled cell death that is intimately related to immunotherapy and the development of cancer is called cuproptosis. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we developed and validated a DNA-methylation located in cuproptosis death-related gene prognostic signature (CRG-located DNA-methylation prognostic signature) to predict CM's prognosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis of our TCGA and GEO cohorts showed that high-risk patients had a shorter overall survival. The area under the curve (AUC) for the TCGA cohort was 0.742, while for the GEO cohort it was 0.733, according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Furthermore, this signature was discovered as an independent prognostic indicator over CM patients based on Cox-regression analysis. Immunogenomic profiling indicated that majority immune-checkpoints got an opposite relationship with the signature, and patients in the group at low risk got higher immunophenoscore. Several immune pathways were enriched, according to functional enrichment analysis. In conclusion, a prognostic methylation signature for CM patients was established and confirmed. Because of its close relationship to the immune landscape, this signature may help clinicians make more accurate and individualized choices regarding therapy.

      Metastatic skin cutaneous melanoma (MSCM) is the most rapidly progressing/invasive skin-based malignancy, with median survival rates of about 12 months. It appears that metabolic disorders accelerate disease progression. However, correlations between metabolism-linked genes (MRGs) and prognosis in MSCM are unclear, and potential mechanisms explaining the correlation are unknown. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was utilized as a training set to develop a genomic signature based on the differentially expressed MRGs (DE-MRGs) between primary skin cutaneous melanoma (PSCM) and MSCM. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) was utilized as a validation set to verify the effectiveness of genomic signature. In addition, a nomogram was established to predict overall survival based on genomic signature and other clinic-based characteristics. Moreover, this study investigated the correlations between genomic signature and tumor micro-environment (TME). This study established a genomic signature consisting of 3 genes (CD38, DHRS3, and TYRP1) and classified MSCM patients into low and high-risk cohorts based on the median risk scores of MSCM cases. It was discovered that cases in the high-risk cohort had significantly lower survival than cases in the low-risk cohort across all sets. Furthermore, a nomogram containing this genomic signature and clinic-based parameters was developed and demonstrated high efficiency in predicting MSCM case survival times. Interestingly, Gene Set Variation Analysis results indicated that the genomic signature was involved in immune-related physiological processes. In addition, this study discovered that risk scoring was negatively correlated with immune-based cellular infiltrations in the TME and critical immune-based checkpoint expression profiles, indicating that favorable prognosis may be influenced in part by immunologically protective micro-environments. A novel 3-genomic signature was found to be reliable for predicting MSCM outcomes and may facilitate personalized immunotherapy."

      Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and terminal exhausted T lymphocyte (ETL) activities crucially influence immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response. Despite this, the efficacy of ETL and CTL transcriptomic signatures for response prediction remains limited. Investigating this across the TCGA and publicly available single-cell cohorts, we find a strong positive correlation between ETL and CTL expression signatures in most cancers. We hence posited that their limited predictability arises due to their mutually canceling effects on ICI response. Thus, we developed DETACH, a computational method to identify a gene set whose expression pinpoints to a subset of melanoma patients where the CTL and ETL correlation is low. DETACH enhances CTL's prediction accuracy, outperforming existing signatures. DETACH signature genes activity also demonstrates a positive correlation with lymphocyte infiltration and the prevalence of reactive T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), advancing our understanding of the CTL cell state within the TME.

      Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), a form of skin cancer, ranks among the most formidable and lethal malignancies. Exploring tumor microenvironment (TME)-based prognostic indicators would help improve the efficacy of immunotherapy for SKCM patients. This study analyzed SKCM scRNA-seq data to cluster non-malignant cells that could be used to explore the TME into nine immune/stromal cell types, including B cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, Fibroblasts, macrophages, neurons, and natural killer (NK) cells. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we employed SKCM expression profiling to identify differentially expressed immune-associated genes (DEIAGs), which were then incorporated into weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to investigate TME-associated hub genes. Discover candidate small molecule drugs based on pivotal genes. Tumor immune microenvironment-associated genes (TIMAGs) for constructing TIMAS were identified and validated. Finally, the characteristics of TIAMS subgroups and the ability of TIMAS to predict immunotherapy outcomes were analyzed. We identified five TIMAGs (CD86, CD80, SEMA4D, C1QA, and IRF1) and used them to construct TIMAS. In addition, five potential SKCM drugs were identified. The results showed that TIMAS-low patients were associated with immune-related signaling pathways, high MUC16 mutation frequency, high T cell infiltration, and M1 macrophages, and were more favorable for immunotherapy. Collectively, TIMAS constructed by comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data is a promising marker for predicting ICI treatment outcomes and improving individualized therapy for SKCM patients.

      A challenge with studying cancer transcriptomes is in distilling the wealth of information down into manageable portions of information. In this resource, we develop an approach that creates and assembles cancer type-specific gene expression modules into flexible barcodes, allowing for adaptation to a wide variety of uses. Specifically, we propose that modules derived organically from high-quality gold standards such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) can accurately capture and describe functionally related genes that are relevant to specific cancer types. We show that such modules can: (1) uncover novel gene relationships and nominate new functional memberships, (2) improve and speed up analysis of smaller or lower-resolution datasets, (3) re-create and expand known cancer subtyping schemes, (4) act as a \"decoder\" to bridge seemingly disparate established gene signatures, and (5) efficiently apply single-cell RNA sequencing information to other datasets. Moreover, such modules can be used in conjunction with native spreadsheet program commands to create a powerful and rapid approach to hypothesis generation and testing that is readily accessible to non-bioinformaticians. Finally, we provide tools for users to create and interpret their own modules. Overall, the flexible modular nature of the proposed barcoding provides a user-friendly approach to rapidly decoding transcriptome-wide data for research or, potentially, clinical uses.

          Background:
        
      
      Uveal melanoma (UVM) is the most common primary ocular malignancy, with a wide range of symptoms and outcomes. The programmed cell death (PCD) plays an important role in tumor development, diagnosis, and prognosis. There is still no research on the relationship between PCD-related genes and UVM. A novel PCD-associated prognostic model is urgently needed to improve treatment strategies.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Objective:
        
      
      We aim to screen PCD-related prognostic signature and investigate its proliferation ability and apoptosis in UVM cells.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      The clinical information and RNA-seq data of the UVM patients were collected from the TCGA cohort. All the patients were classified using consensus clustering by the selected PCD-related genes. After univariate Cox regression and PPI network analysis, the prognostic PCD-related genes were then submitted to the LASSO regression analysis to build a prognostic model. The level of immune infiltration of 8-PCD signature in high- and low-risk patients was analyzed using xCell. The prediction on chemotherapy and immunotherapy response in UVM patients was assessed by GDSC and TIDE algorithm. CCK-8, western blot and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining were used to explore the roles of HMOX1 in UVM cells.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      A total of 8-PCD signature was constructed and the risk score of the PCD signature was negatively correlated with the overall survival, indicating strong predictive ability and independent prognostic value. The risk score was positively correlated with CD8 Tcm, CD8 Tem and Th2 cells. Immune cells in high-risk group had poorer overall survival. The drug sensitivity demonstrated that cisplatin might impact the progression of UVM and better immunotherapy responsiveness in the high-risk group. Finally, Overespression HMOX1 (OE-HMOX1) decreased the cell viability and induced apoptosis in UVM cells. Recuse experiment results showed that ferrostatin-1 (fer-1) protected MP65 cells from apoptosis and necrosis caused by OE-HMOX1.

      The PCD signature may have a significant role in the tumor microenvironment, clinicopathological characteristics, prognosis and drug sensitivity. More importantly, HMOX1 depletion greatly induced tumor cell growth and inhibited cell apoptosis and fer-1 protected UVM cells from apoptosis and necrosis induced by OE-HMOX1. This work provides a foundation for effective therapeutic strategy in tumour treatment.

The concordance index (C-index) was 0.794 in the training set, and 0.792 and 0.821 in the internal and external validation sets, respectively. The corresponding area under curve (AUC) was all above 0.75 in these data sets. Functional enrichment analysis revealed significant associations with immune response and inflammatory processes. PPI analysis identified key molecular modules associated with apoptosis and chemokine signaling. Consensus clustering unveiled three discernible subtypes demonstrating notable disparities in survival outcomes based on CDI expression profiles. Assessment of the tumor microenvironment highlighted correlations with immune cell infiltration such as M1 macrophages and T cells. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated tight correlations between CDI levels and response to immunotherapy.

      Our comprehensive analysis establishes the prognostic significance of PCD-related genes in SKCM. CDI emerges as a promising prognostic biomarker, offering insights into tumor biology and potential implications for personalized treatment strategies. Further validation and clinical integration of CDI are warranted to improve SKCM management and patient outcomes.

          Objectives:
        
      
      Melanoma is highly malignant and heterogeneous. It is essential to develop a specific prognostic model for improving the patients' survival and treatment strategies. Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis results from the overproduction of lipid peroxidation and is an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death. Despite this, ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) and their clinical significances remain unknown in malignant melanoma. This study aims to assess the role of FRGs in melanoma, with the goal of developing a novel prognostic model that provides new insights into personalized treatment and improvement of therapeutic outcomes for melanoma.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      We systematically characterized the genetic alterations and mRNA expression of 73 FRGs in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) dataset in this study. The results were validated with real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Subsequently, a multi-gene feature model was constructed using the TCGA-SKCM cohort. Melanoma patients were classified into a high-risk group and a low-risk group based on the feature model. As a final step, correlations between ferroptosis-related signatures and immune features, immunotherapy efficacy, or drug response were analyzed.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      By analyzing melanoma samples from TCGA-SKCM dataset, FRGs exhibited a high frequency of genetic mutations and copy number variations (CNVs), significantly impacting gene expression. Additionally, compared with normal skin tissue, 30 genes with significantly differential expression were identified in melanoma tissues. A prognostic model related to FRGs, constructed using the LASSO Cox regression method, identified 13 FRGs associated with overall survival prognosis in patients and was validated with external datasets. Finally, functional enrichment and immune response analysis further indicated significant differences in immune cell infiltration, mutation burden, and hypoxia status between the high-risk group and the low-risk group, and the model was effective in predicting responses to immunotherapy and drug sensitivity.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study develops a strong ferroptosis-related prognostic signature model which could put forward new insights into target therapy and immunotherapy for patients with melanoma.

          Background:
        
      
      Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM) incidence is continually increasing, with chemotherapy and immunotherapy being among the most common cancer treatment modalities. This study aims to identify novel biomarkers for chemotherapy and immunotherapy response in SKCM and explore their association with oxidative stress.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      Utilizing TCGA-SKCM RNA-seq data, we employed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks to identify six core genes. Gene co-expression analysis and immune-related analysis were conducted, and specific markers associated with oxidative stress were identified using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA). Single-cell analysis revealed the expression patterns of Oxidative Stress-Associated Genes (OSAG) in the tumor microenvironment. TIDE analysis was employed to explore the association between immune therapy response and OSAG, while CIBERSORT was used to analyze the tumor immune microenvironment. The BEST database demonstrated the impact of the Oxidative Stress signaling pathway on chemotherapy drug resistance. Immunohistochemical staining and ROC curve evaluation were performed to assess the protein expression levels of core genes in SKCM and normal samples, with survival analysis utilized to determine their diagnostic value.

      We identified six central genes associated with SKCM metastasis, among which the expression of DSC2 and DSC3 involved in the oxidative stress pathway was closely related to immune cell infiltration. DSC2 influenced drug resistance in SKMC patients. Furthermore, downregulation of DSC2 and DSC3 expression enhanced the response of SKCM patients to immunotherapy.

      Uveal melanoma (UVM) is the most common primary tumor in adult human eyes. Costimulatory molecules (CMs) are important in maintaining T cell biological functions and regulating immune responses. To investigate the role of CMs in UVM and exploit prognostic signature by bioinformatics analysis. This study aimed to identify and validate a CMs associated signature and investigate its role in the progression and prognosis of UVM. The expression profile data of training cohort and validation cohort were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. 60 CM genes were identified, and 34 genes were associated with prognosis by univariate Cox regression. A prognostic signature was established with six CM genes. Further, high- and low-risk groups were divided by the median, and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves indicated that high-risk patients presented a poorer prognosis. We analyzed the correlation of gender, age, stage, and risk score on prognosis by univariate and multivariate regression analysis. We found that risk score was the only risk factor for prognosis. Through the integration of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), it was found that the high-risk group presented more immune cell infiltration and expression of immune checkpoints and obtained higher immune scores. Enrichment analysis of the biological functions of the two groups revealed that the differential parts were mainly related to cell-cell adhesion, regulation of T-cell activation, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. No differences in tumor mutation burden (TMB) were found between the two groups. GNA11 and BAP1 have higher mutation frequencies in high-risk patients. Finally, based on the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer 2 (GDSC2) dataset, drug sensitivity analysis found that high-risk patients may be potential beneficiaries of the treatment of crizotinib or temozolomide. Taken together, our CM-related prognostic signature is a reliable biomarker that may provide ideas for future treatments for the disease.

      The mortality and therapeutic failure in cutaneous melanoma (CM) are mainly caused by wide metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. Meanwhile, immunotherapy is considered a crucial therapy strategy for CM patients. However, the efficiency of currently available methods and biomarkers in predicting the response of immunotherapy and prognosis of CM is limited. Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a significant role in the occurrence, development, and therapy of various malignant tumors. In this research, we integrated fourteen types of PCD, multi-omics data from TCGA-SKCM and other cohorts in GEO, and clinical CM patients to develop our analysis. Based on significant PCD patterns, two PCD-related CM clusters with different prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME), and response to immunotherapy were identified. Subsequently, seven PCD-related features, especially CD28, CYP1B1, JAK3, LAMP3, SFN, STAT4, and TRAF1, were utilized to establish the prognostic signature, namely cell death index (CDI). CDI accurately predicted the response to immunotherapy in both CM and other cancers. A nomogram with potential superior predictive ability was constructed, and potential drugs targeting CM patients with specific CDI have also been identified. Given all the above, a novel CDI gene signature was indicated to predict the prognosis and exploit precision therapeutic strategies of CM patients, providing unique opportunities for clinical intelligence and new management methods for the therapy of CM.

      Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a common cause of cancer-related death. Due to the difficulty in early diagnosis and drug resistance, conventional treatments are difficult to be effective. Some studies have found that the functional recovery of T cells in the tumor microenvironment, especially regulatory T cells (Tregs), plays an important role in the progression of cancer. This study used the TCGA data set, clinical information and RNA-seq data of COAD patients to construct a Tregs-related risk score (TRS) through methods such as WGCNA, single-factor Cox, multi-factor Cox and random survival forest (RSF). Moreover, we also used the TCGA test set and internal validation set to verify the predictive ability of TRS, and used functional enrichment analysis and somatic mutation analysis to mine genes related to TRS, such as like thrombin/trypsin receptor 2 (F2RL2), inhibin subunit beta B (INHBB) and melanoma antigen family A12 (MAGEA12). Moreover, this study confirmed the expression of these prognostic genes using scRNA-seq data. We also performed qPCR analysis of various genes in normal and cancerous colon cancer cell lines to verify that these genes indeed play a role in CODA patients. We also constructed a mouse CODA model to study and evaluate the impact of key genes such as MAGEA12 on tumor growth in mice. This study explores the important role of Treg cells in the prognosis of COAD and discovers some potential biomarkers for the occurrence and development of COAD, which provides some new ideas for the treatment of COAD.

      Cutaneous melanoma poses a formidable challenge within the field of oncology, marked by its aggressive nature and capacity for metastasis. Despite extensive research uncovering numerous genetic and molecular contributors to cutaneous melanoma development, there remains a critical knowledge gap concerning the role of lipids, notably low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in this lethal skin cancer. This article endeavours to bridge this knowledge gap by delving into the intricate interplay between LDL metabolism and cutaneous melanoma, shedding light on how lipids influence tumour progression, immune responses and potential therapeutic avenues. Genes associated with LDL metabolism were extracted from the GSEA database. We acquired and analysed single-cell sequencing data (GSE215120) and bulk-RNA sequencing data, including the TCGA data set, GSE19234, GSE22153 and GSE65904. Our analysis unveiled the heterogeneity of LDL across various cell types at the single-cell sequencing level. Additionally, we constructed an LDL-related signature (LRS) using machine learning algorithms, incorporating differentially expressed genes and highly correlated genes. The LRS serves as a valuable tool for assessing the prognosis, immunity and mutation status of patients with cutaneous melanoma. Furthermore, we conducted experiments on A375 and WM-115 cells to validate the function of PPP2R1A, a pivotal gene within the LRS. Our comprehensive approach, combining advanced bioinformatics analyses with an extensive review of current literature, presents compelling evidence regarding the significance of LDL within the cutaneous melanoma microenvironment.

      The R package Seurat facilitated the analysis of the single-cell dataset, while Harmony, another R package, was employed for batch effect correction. Cell types were classified using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). The Secreted Signaling algorithm from CellChatDB.human was applied to elucidate cell-to-cell communication patterns within the single-cell data. Consensus clustering analysis for the skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) samples was executed with the R package ConsensusClusterPlus. To quantify immune infiltrating cells, we utilized CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, and TIMERxCell algorithms provided by the R package Immuno-Oncology Biological Research (IOBR). Single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis was conducted using Maftools, an R package specifically designed for this purpose. Subsequently, the expression levels of PXDN and PAPSS2 genes were assessed in melanoma tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, in vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the proliferation and reactive oxygen species expression in melanoma cells following transfection with siRNA targeting PXDN and PAPSS2.

      Malignant tumor cell populations were reclassified based on a comprehensive single-cell dataset analysis, which yielded six distinct tumor subsets. The specific marker genes identified for these subgroups were then used to interrogate the Cancer Genome Atlas Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (TCGA-SKCM) cohort, derived from bulk RNA sequencing data, resulting in the delineation of two immune molecular subtypes. Notably, patients within the cluster2 (C2) subtype exhibited a significantly more favorable prognosis compared to those in the cluster1 (C1) subtype. An alignment of immune characteristics was observed between the C2 subtype and unique immune functional tumor cell subsets. Genes differentially expressed across these subtypes were subsequently leveraged to construct a predictive risk model. In vitro investigations further revealed elevated expression levels of PXDN and PAPSS2 in melanoma tissue samples. Functional assays indicated that modulation of PXDN and PAPSS2 expression could influence the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the proliferative capacity of melanoma cells.

          Background:
        
      
      Centrosome aberration (CA) plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and metastasis under pathophysiological conditions. The existence of CA was first reported in uveal melanoma (UVM) recently. Our study aimed to investigate the association of centrosome-related genes with UVM prognosis.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-UVM and Gene Expression Omnibus series (GSE) 22138 were included in the study. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Cox regression were combined to screen out key genes and construct a centrosome-related gene signature. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves were used to evaluate the survival differences between the 2 groups. Gene enrichment, immune infiltration, and mutation profile were used to explore the underlying mechanism.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      A centrosome-related gene signature was constructed: Risk score =-3.27071 × MAP6 - 5.03735 × CCDC40 - 2.68459 × PRKCD + 1.826349 × IGFBP4 + 11.66582 × RAB6C - 4.86899 × CCND3. The survival possibilities of the two groups were significantly different. The high-risk group showed cancer progression, inflammation, and immune restriction characteristics when compared with the low-risk group. BAP1 mutation was associated with high risk and SF3B1 mutation was associated with low risk according to the signature.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study first investigated the role of centrosome-related genes in UVM overall survival (OS). We then constructed a centrosome-related gene signature for UVM, which provides new insights into the role of CA in UVM and identifies novel centrosome-related biomarkers.

      Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is defined as differences in molecular and phenotypic profiles between different tumor cells and immune cells within a tumor. ITH was involved in the cancer progression, aggressiveness, therapy resistance and cancer recurrence. Integrative machine learning procedure including 10 methods was conducted to develop an ITH-related signature (IRS) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), GSE54467, GSE59455 and GSE65904 cohort. Several scores, including tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) score, tumor mutation burden (TMB) score and immunophenoscore (IPS), were used to evaluate the role of IRS in predicting immunotherapy benefits. Two immunotherapy datasets (GSE91061 and GSE78220) were utilized to the role of IRS in predicting immunotherapy benefits of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) patients. The optimal prognostic IRS constructed by Lasso method acted as an independent risk factor and had a stable and powerful performance in predicting the overall survival rate in SKCM, with the area under the curve of 2-, 3- and 4-year receiver operating characteristic curve being 0.722, 0.722 and 0.737 in TCGA cohort. We also constructed a nomogram and the actual 1-, 3- and 5-year survival times were highly consistent with the predicted survival times. SKCM patients with low IRS scores had a lower TIDE score, lower immune escape score and higher TMB score, higher PD1&CTLA4 IPS. Moreover, SKCM patients with low IRS scores had a lower gene sets score involved in DNA repair, angiogenesis, glycolysis, hypoxia, IL2-STAT5 signaling, MTORC1 signaling, NOTCH signaling and P53 pathway. The current study constructed a novel IRS in SKCM using 10 machine learning methods. This IRS acted as an indicator for predicting the prognosis and immunotherapy benefits of SKCM patients."

          Background:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to build a prognostic model for cutaneous melanoma (CM) using fatty acid-related genes and evaluate its capacity for predicting prognosis, identifying the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) composition, and assessing drug sensitivity.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      Through the analysis of transcriptional data from TCGA-SKCM and GTEx datasets, we screened for differentially expressed fatty acids-related genes (DEFAGs). Additionally, we employed clinical data from TCGA-SKCM and GSE65904 to identify genes associated with prognosis. Subsequently, utilizing all the identified prognosis-related fatty acid genes, we performed unsupervised clustering analysis using the ConsensusClusterPlus R package. We further validated the significant differences between subtypes through survival analysis and pathway analysis. To predict prognosis, we developed a LASSO-Cox prognostic signature. This signature's predictive ability was rigorously examined through multivariant Cox regression, survival analysis, and ROC curve analysis. Following this, we constructed a nomogram based on the aforementioned signature and evaluated its accuracy and clinical utility using calibration curves, cumulative hazard rates, and decision curve analysis. Using this signature, we stratified all cases into high- and low-risk groups and compared the differences in immune characteristics and drug treatment responsiveness between these two subgroups. Additionally, in this study, we provided preliminary confirmation of the pivotal role of CD1D in the TIME of CM. We analyzed its expression across various immune cell types and its correlation with intercellular communication using single-cell data from the GSE139249 dataset.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      In this study, a total of 84 DEFAGs were identified, among which 18 were associated with prognosis. Utilizing these 18 prognosis-related genes, all cases were categorized into three subtypes. Significant differences were observed between subtypes in terms of survival outcomes, the expression of the 18 DEFAGs, immune cell proportions, and enriched pathways. A LASSO-Cox regression analysis was performed on these 18 genes, leading to the development of a signature comprising 6 DEFAGs. Risk scores were calculated for all cases, dividing them into high-risk and low-risk groups. High-risk patients exhibited significantly poorer prognosis than low-risk patients, both in the training group (p < 0.001) and the test group (p = 0.002). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that this signature could independently predict outcomes [HR = 2.03 (1.69-2.45), p < 0.001]. The area under the ROC curve for the training and test groups was 0.715 and 0.661, respectively. Combining risk scores with clinical factors including metastatic status and patient age, a nomogram was constructed, which demonstrated significant predictive power for 3 and 5 years patient outcomes. Furthermore, the high and low-risk subgroups displayed differences in the composition of various immune cells, including M1 macrophages, M0 macrophages, and CD8+ T cells. The low-risk subgroup exhibited higher StromalScore, ImmuneScore, and ESTIMATEScore (p < 0.001) and demonstrated better responsiveness to immune therapy for patients with PD1-positive and CTLA4-negative or positive expressions (p < 0.001). The signature gene CD1D was found to be mainly expressed in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells within the TIME. Through intercellular communication analysis, it was observed that cases with high CD1D expression exhibited significantly enhanced signal transductions from other immune cells to monocytes/macrophages, particularly the (HLA-A/B/C/E/F)-CD8A signaling from natural killer (NK) cells to monocytes/macrophages (p < 0.01).
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      The prognostic signature constructed in this study, based on six fatty acid-related genes, exhibits strong capabilities in predicting patient outcomes, identifying the TIME, and assessing drug sensitivity. This signature can aid in patient risk stratification and provide guidance for clinical treatment strategies. Additionally, our research highlights the crucial role of CD1D in the CM's TIME, laying a theoretical foundation for future related studies.

          Background:
        
      
      Uveal melanoma (UM) is an aggressive intraocular malignant tumor. The present study aimed to identify the key genes associated with UM metastasis and established a gene signature to analyze the relationship between the signature and prognosis and immune cell infiltration. Later, a predictive model combined with clinical variables was developed and validated.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      Two UM gene expression profile chip datasets were downloaded from TCGA and GEO databases. Immune-related genes (IRGs) were obtained from IMPORT database. First, these mRNAs were intersected with IRGs, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the co-expression of genes primarily associated with metastasis of UM. Univariate Cox regression analysis screened the genes related to prognosis. LASSO-Cox established a risk score to distinguish high-risk group and low-risk group. Then the GSEA enrichment pathway and immune cell infiltration of the two groups were compared. And combined with clinical variables, a predictive model was constructed. The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curve were used to verify the stability and accuracy of the final predictive model, and a nomogram was then drawn.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      The MEblack, MEpurple, and MEblue modules were significantly associated with the metastasis of UM patients (P value < 0.001, = 0.001, = 0.022, respectively). Four genes (UBXN2B, OTUD3, KAT8, LAMTOR2) were obtained by Pearson correlation analysis, weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), univariate Cox, and LASSO-Cox. And a novel prognostic risk score was established. Immune-related prognostic signature can well classify UM patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier curve showed that the OS of high-risk patients was worse than that of low-risk patients. In addition, the risk score played an important role in evaluating the signaling pathway and immune cell infiltration of UM patients in high-risk and low-risk groups. Both the training set and validation set of the model showed good predictive accuracy in the degree of differentiation and calibration (e.g., 1-year overall survival: AUC = 0.930 (0.857-1.003)). Finally, a nomogram was established to serve in clinical practice.

      Despite autophagy modulating tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment (TME), the immunotherapeutic efficacy and potential mechanism of autophagy signature was not explicit. We manually curated an autophagy gene set and defined a pan-cancer autophagy signature by comparing malignant tissues and normal tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. The pan-cancer autophagy signature was derived from T proliferating cells as demonstrated in multiple single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. The pan-cancer autophagy signature could influence the cell-cell interactions in the TME and predict the responsiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the metastatic renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, and melanoma cohorts. Metabolism inactivation accompanied with dysregulation of autophagy was investigated with transcriptomic and proteomic data. The immunotherapeutic predictive role and mechanism regulation of the autophagy signature was validated in an in-house cohort. Our study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of ICI resistance.

      Despite advancements in treating metastatic melanoma, many patients exhibit resistance to targeted therapies. Our study focuses on ATP1A1, a sodium pump subunit associated with cancer development. We aimed to assess ATP1A1 prognostic value in melanoma patients and examine the impact of its ligand, bufalin, on melanoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. High ATP1A1 expression (IHC) correlated with reduced overall survival in melanoma patients. Resistance to BRAF inhibitor was linked to elevated ATP1A1 levels in patient biopsies (IHC, qPCR) and cell lines (Western blot, qPCR). Additionally, high ATP1A1 mRNA expression positively correlated with differentiation/pigmentation markers based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases and Verfaillie proliferative gene signature analysis. Bufalin specifically targeted ATP1A1 in caveolae, (proximity ligation assay) and influenced Src phosphorylation (Western blot), thereby disrupting multiple signaling pathways (phosphokinase array). In vitro, bufalin induced apoptosis in melanoma cell lines by acting on ATP1A1 (siRNA experiments) and, in vivo, significantly impeded melanoma growth using a nude mouse xenograft model with continuous bufalin delivery via an osmotic pump. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that ATP1A1 could serve as a prognostic marker for patient survival and a predictive marker for response to BRAF inhibitor therapy. By targeting ATP1A1, bufalin inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis in vitro, and effectively suppressed tumor development in mice. Thus, our findings strongly support ATP1A1 as a promising therapeutic target, with bufalin as a potential agent to disrupt its tumor-promoting activity.

      In this study, genes linked to prognosis in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) involved in programmed cell death (PCD) were identified and confirmed and prognostic models based on these genes were constructed. Acquisition and analysis of clinical data and RNA sequencing information from The Cancer Genome Atlas-SKCM (TCGA-SKCM) and Sangerbox databases, gene expression data for 477 tumor samples and 2 normal samples were successfully gathered. The patients were separated into two clusters based on consensus clustering of PCD-related genes, with Cluster A having greater tumor purity, ESTIMATE score, immune score, and matrix score, and Cluster B having a significantly distinct pattern of immune cell infiltration. The use of gene set enrichment analysis and weighted correlation network analysis showed significant associations between certain genes and factors such as tumor mutation burden, age, stage, grade, and tumor subtype. Finally, based on the 12 genes selected by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression analysis (STAT3, IRF2, SLC7A11, ZEB1, LIPT1, PML, GCH1, GYS1, ABCC1, XBP1, TFAP2C, NOX4), a prognostic model of PGD-related genes was constructed. The effectiveness of the model's prognostic value was confirmed through survival analysis, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve, single-factor Cox regression analysis, and nomogram. We also verified the relationship between the GCH1 and MKI67 expression by wet experiment. This model has high prediction accuracy in SKCM patients and can provide a reference for clinical treatment.

      In this cohort, gPV-positive patients (n = 72) had a significantly improved melanoma-specific survival (MSS) compared with gPV-negative patients (n = 411; HRadj, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.82; P = 0.01). These survival improvements among gPV-positive patients were most apparent among cutaneous melanoma subtypes (HRadj, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.016-0.86; P = 0.03) and numerically improved in later-stage (IIB-IV) patients (HRadj, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.10-1.11; P = 0.06). Further, gPV-positive patients had a significantly lower level of total circulating PMN-MDSC compared with gPV-negative patients (P = 0.01), which was most apparent in those diagnosed with later stages (IIB-IV) of melanoma (P = 0.009). Finally, a significant upregulation of inflammatory transcriptome signatures in later-stage gPV-positive patients (n = 21) was observed in comparison with gPV-negative patients (n = 173) in the cutaneous melanoma cohort (SKCM) of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

The model was further subjected to immune infiltration, functional enrichment, tumor mutational load, immunotherapy prediction, and scRNA-seq data analysis. Finally, cellular experiments were conducted to validate the functionality of the key gene GPR19 in the model.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      The findings indicate that high expression of GPRGs is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with SKCM, highlighting the significant role of GPRGs and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in SKCM development. Notably, the group characterized by low GPR expression and a high TME exhibited the most favorable prognosis and immunotherapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, cellular assays demonstrated that knockdown of GPR19 significantly reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasive capabilities of melanoma cells in A375 and A2058 cell lines.

NOTCH3, PIK3R2, and SOD2 were validated in our clinical samples by immunohistochemistry.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      The prognostic model for melanoma patients was developed utilizing ten hub anoikis-related genes. The overall survival (OS) of patients in the high-risk subgroup, which was classified by the optimal cutoff value, was remarkably shorter in the TCGA-melanoma, GSE65904, and GSE22155 data sets. Low-risk patients exhibited low immune cell infiltration and high expression of immunophenoscores and immune checkpoints. They also demonstrated increased sensitivity to various drugs, including dasatinib and dabrafenib. NOTCH3, PIK3R2, and SOD2 were notably associated with OS by univariate Cox analysis in the GSE65904 data set. The clinical melanoma samples showed remarkably higher protein expressions of NOTCH3 (P = 0.003) and PIK3R2 (P = 0.009) than the para-melanoma samples, while the SOD2 protein expression remained unchanged.

      Oncogenic Gαq causes uveal melanoma via non-canonical signaling pathways. This constitutively active mutant GTPase is also found in cutaneous melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and seminoma, as well as in benign vascular tumors, such as congenital hemangiomas. We recently described that PDZ-RhoGEF (also known as ARHGEF11), a canonical Gα12/13 effector, is enabled by Gαs Q227L to activate CdcIn addition, and we demonstrated that constitutively active Gαq interacts with the PDZ-RhoGEF DH-PH catalytic module, but does not affect its binding to RhoA or Cdc. This suggests that it guides this RhoGEF to gain affinity for other GTPases. Since RhoJ, a small GTPase of the Cdc42 subfamily, has been involved in tumor-induced angiogenesis and the metastatic dissemination of cancer cells, we hypothesized that it might be a target of oncogenic Gαq signaling via PDZ-RhoGEF. Consistent with this possibility, we found that Gαq Q209L drives full-length PDZ-RhoGEF and a DH-PH construct to interact with nucleotide-free RhoJ-G33A, a mutant with affinity for active RhoJ-GEFs. Gαq Q209L binding to PDZ-RhoGEF was mapped to the PH domain, which, as an isolated construct, attenuated the interaction of this mutant GTPase with PDZ-RhoGEF's catalytic module (DH-PH domains). Expression of these catalytic domains caused contraction of endothelial cells and generated fine cell sprouts that were inhibited by co-expression of dominant negative RhoJ. Using relational data mining of uveal melanoma patient TCGA datasets, we got an insight into the signaling landscape that accompanies the Gαq/PDZ-RhoGEF/RhoJ axis. We identified three transcriptional signatures statistically linked with shorter patient survival, including GPCRs and signaling effectors that are recognized as vulnerabilities in cancer cell synthetic lethality datasets. In conclusion, we demonstrated that an oncogenic Gαq mutant enables the PDZ-RhoGEF DH-PH module to recognize RhoJ, suggesting an allosteric mechanism by which this constitutively active GTPase stimulates RhoJ via PDZ-RhoGEF. These findings highlight PDZ-RhoGEF and RhoJ as potential targets in tumors driven by mutant Gαq.

          Background:
        
      
      The incidence of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), one of the most aggressive and lethal skin tumors, is increasing worldwide. However, for advanced SKCM, we still lack an accurate and valid way to predict its prognosis, as well as novel theories to guide the planning of treatment options for SKCM patients. Lactylation (LAC), a novel post-translational modification of histones, has been shown to promote tumor growth and inhibit the antitumor response of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a variety of ways. We hope that this study will provide new ideas for treatment options for SKCM patients, as well as research on the molecular mechanisms of SKCM pathogenesis and development.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      At the level of the RNA sequencing set (TCGA, GTEx), we used differential expression analysis, LASSO regression analysis, and multifactor Cox regression analysis to screen for prognosis-related genes and calculate the corresponding LAC scores. The content of TME cells in the tumor tissue was calculated using the CIBERSORT algorithm, and the TME score was calculated based on its results. Finally, the LAC-TME classifier was established and further analyzed based on the two scores, including the construction of a prognostic model, analysis of clinicopathological characteristics, and correlation analysis of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immunotherapy. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing data, this study analyzed the cellular composition in SKCM tissues and explored the role of LAC scores in intercellular communication. To validate the functionality of the pivotal gene CLPB in the model, cellular experiments were ultimately executed.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      We screened a total of six prognosis-related genes (NDUFA10, NDUFA13, CLPB, RRM2B, HPDL, NARS2) and 7 TME cells with good prognosis. According to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we found that the LAClow/TMEhigh group had the highest overall survival (OS) and the LAChigh/TMElow group had the lowest OS (p value < 0.05). In further analysis of immune infiltration, tumor microenvironment (TME), functional enrichment, tumor mutational load and immunotherapy, we found that immunotherapy was more appropriate in the LAClow/TMEhigh group. Moreover, the cellular assays exhibited substantial reductions in proliferation, migration, and invasive potentials of melanoma cells in both A375 and A2058 cell lines upon CLPB knockdown.

      The prognostic model using the combined LAC score and TME score was able to predict the prognosis of SKCM patients more consistently, and the LAC-TME classifier was able to significantly differentiate the prognosis of SKCM patients across multiple clinicopathological features. The LAC-TME classifier has an important role in the development of immunotherapy regimens for SKCM patients.

In addition to patient serum, we analyzed primary melanoma tumor cells from NR and found a potential marker signature with four key markers: LAMC1, PXDN, SERPINE1, and VCAN."

          Background:
        
      
      Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is one of the most aggressive cancers with high mortality rates. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play essential roles in tumor growth, metastasis and the establishment of a pro-tumor microenvironment. This study aimed to establish a CAF-related signature for providing a new perspective for indicating prognosis and guiding therapeutic regimens of SKCM patients.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      In this study, the CAF-related genes were screened out based on melanoma-associated fibroblast markers identified from single-cell transcriptome analysis in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and a CAF-related module identified from weighted gene co-expression analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We extracted these gene expression data of SKCM samples from TCGA and constructed a prognostic CAF-related signature. The prediction abilities of the signature for survival prognosis, tumor immune landscape and responses to chemo-/immunotherapies were evaluated in the TCGA-SKCM cohort.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      We suggested that CAFs were significantly involved in the clinical outcomes of SKCM. A 10-gene CAF-related model was constructed, and the high-CAF risk group exhibited immunosuppressive features and worse prognosis. Patients with high CAF score were more likely to not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors but were more sensitive to some chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting a potential approach of chemotherapy/anti-CAF combination treatment to improve the SKCM patient response rate of current immunotherapies.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      The CAF-related risk score could serve as a robust prognostic indicator and personal assessment of this score could uncover the degree of immunosuppression and provide treatment strategies to improve outcomes in clinical decision-making in SKCM patients.

      Anoikis is a unique form of apoptosis associated with vascularization and distant metastasis in cancer. Eliminating anoikis resistance in tumor cells could be a promising target for improving the prognosis of terminal cancer patients. However, current studies have not elaborated on the prognosis effect of anoikis-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous melanoma. Pre-processed data, including RNA sequences and clinical information, were retrieved from TCGA and GTEx databases. After a series of statistical analyses, anoikis-related lncRNAs with prognostic significance were identified, and a unique risk signature was constructed. Risk scores were further analyzed in relation to the tumor microenvironment, tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion, immune checkpoint genes, and RNA methylation genes. The indicators were also used to predict the potentially sensitive anti-cancer drugs. An anoikis-related lncRNAs risk signature consisting of LINC01711, POLH-AS1, MIR205HG, and LINC02416 was successfully established in cutaneous melanoma. Overall survival and progression-free survival of patients were strongly linked with the risk score, independently of other clinical factors. The low-risk group exhibited a more beneficial immunological profile, was less affected by RNA methylation, and was more sensitive to the majority of anti-cancer drugs, all of which indicated a better prognostic outcome. The 4 hub lncRNAs may be fundamental to studying the mechanism of anoikis in cutaneous melanoma and provide personalized therapy for salvaging drug resistance."

Patients with a low-risk score were more responsive to ICIs and had better overall survival (OS) than those with a high-risk score in the training set (HR, 0.38; 95%CI, 0.27-0.53, P<0.001) and the test set (HR, 0.34; 95%CI, 0.17-0.71, P=0.003). The association between the CCCP risk score and OS remained significant in the multivariable cox regression by adjusting PD-L1 expression and TMB (P<0.05). In addition, there was no difference for OS in the bladder cancer patients without ICIs (TCGA-BLCA cohort, HR, 0.76, 95%CI, 0.49-1.18, P=0.22), suggesting a predictive but not prognostic effect of the risk score. For the exploratory analysis, consistent results were observed that low-risk group showed superior OS in ccRCC cohort (HR, 0.52, 95%CI, 0.37-0.75, P<0.001) and melanoma cohort (HR, 0.27, 95%CI, 0.12-0.62, P=0.001).
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study showed that the CCCP risk score is an independent biomarker that predicts the efficacy of ICIs in mUC patients. The patients with a low-risk score tend to have a better response to ICIs and a longer life time probably due to the immune-activated TME. Further studies are needed to validate the clinical utility of the seven-gene signature.

      Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has become the standard of care for several solid tumors. Multiple combinatorial approaches have been studied to improve therapeutic efficacy. The combination of antiangiogenic agents and ICB has demonstrated efficacy in several cancers. To improve the mechanistic understanding of synergies with these treatment modalities, we performed screens of sera from long-term responding patients treated with ipilimumab and bevacizumab. We discovered a high-titer antibody response against EGF-like repeats and discoidin I-like domains protein 3 (EDIL3) that correlated with favorable clinical outcomes. EDIL3 is an extracellular protein, previously identified as a marker of poor prognosis in various malignancies. Our Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion analysis predicted that EDIL3 was associated with immune exclusion signatures for cytotoxic immune cell infiltration and nonresponse to ICB. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) were predicted as the source of EDIL3 in immune exclusion-related cells. Furthermore, The Cancer Genome Atlas Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (TCGA-SKCM) and CheckMate 064 data analyses correlated high levels of EDIL3 with increased pan-fibroblast TGFβ response, enrichment of angiogenic signatures, and induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our in vitro studies validated EDIL3 overexpression and TGFβ regulation in patient-derived CAFs. In pretreatment serum samples from patients, circulating levels of EDIL3 were associated with circulating levels of VEGF, and like VEGF, EDIL3 increased the angiogenic abilities of patient-derived tumor endothelial cells (TEC). Mechanistically, three-dimensional microfluidic cultures and two-dimensional transmigration assays with TEC endorsed EDIL3-mediated disruption of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-ICAM-1 interaction as a possible means of T-cell exclusion. We propose EDIL3 as a potential target for improving the transendothelial migration of immune cells and efficacy of ICB therapy."

          Background:
        
      
      Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most common malignant tumor of the skin. Our study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of pathomics signatures for CM by combining pathomics and genomics.

      The purpose of this study was to explore the potential application value of pathomics signatures.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      Pathology full scans, clinical information, and genomics data for CM patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was used to visualize patient characteristics. Genes related to a poorer prognosis were screened through differential analysis. Survival analysis was performed to assess the prognostic value of gene and pathomics signatures. Artificial neural network (ANN) models predicted prognosis using signatures and genes. Correlation analysis was used to explore signature-gene links.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      The clinical traits for 468 CM samples and the genomic data and pathology images for 471 CM samples were obtained from the TCGA database. The EDA results combined with multiple machine learning (ML) models suggested that the top 5 clinical traits in terms of importance were age, biopsy site, T stage, N stage and overall disease stage, and the eight ML models had a precision lower than 0.56. A total of 60 differentially expressed genes were obtained by comparing sequencing data. A total of 413 available quantitative signatures of each pathomics image were obtained with CellProfile software. The precision of the binary classification model based on pathomics signatures was 0.99, with a loss value of 1.7119e-04. The precision of the binary classification model based on differentially expressed genes was 0.98, with a loss value of 0.1101. The precision of the binary classification model based on pathomics signatures and differentially expressed genes was 0.97, with a loss value of 0.2088. The survival analyses showed that the survival rate of the high-risk group based on gene expression and pathomics signatures was significantly lower than that of the low-risk group. A total of 222 pathomics signatures and 51 differentially expressed genes were analyzed for survival with p-values of less than 0.05. There was a certain correlation between some pathomics signatures and differential gene expression involving ANO2, LINC00158, NDNF, ADAMTS15, and ADGRB3, etc. CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the prognostic significance of pathomics signatures and differentially expressed genes in CM patients. Three ANN models were developed, and all achieved accuracy rates higher than 97%. Specifically, the pathomics signature-based ANN model maintained a remarkable accuracy of 99%. These findings highlight the CellProfile + ANN model as an excellent choice for prognostic prediction in CM patients. Furthermore, our correlation analysis experimentally demonstrated a preliminary link between disease quantification and qualitative changes. Among various features, including M stage and treatments received, special attention should be given to age, biopsy site, T stage, N stage, and overall disease stage in CM patients."

By combining the gene expression level with the corresponding regression coefficient, a risk score was calculated and all patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups. Survival, tumor-infiltrating immune cell abundance, dysregulated signaling pathways, immunophenoscore and tumor mutation burden were compared between two groups. Validation of the risk signature was performed in GSE22138 and GSE44295 cohort.

      We aimed to develop endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related risk signature to predict the prognosis of melanoma and elucidate the immune characteristics and benefit of immunotherapy in ER-related risk score-defined subgroups of melanoma based on a machine learning algorithm. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) melanoma dataset (n = 471) and GTEx database (n = 813), 365 differentially expressed ER-associated genes were selected using the univariate Cox model and LASSO penalty Cox model. Ten genes impacting OS were identified to construct an ER-related signature by using the multivariate Cox regression method and validated with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. Thereafter, the immune features, CNV, methylation, drug sensitivity, and the clinical benefit of anticancer immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in risk score subgroups, were analyzed. We further validated the gene signature using pan-cancer analysis by comparing it to other tumor types. The ER-related risk score was constructed based on the ARNTL, AGO1, TXN, SORL1, CHD7, EGFR, KIT, HLA-DRB1 KCNA2, and EDNRB genes. The high ER stress-related risk score group patients had a poorer overall survival (OS) than the low-risk score group patients, consistent with the results in the GEO cohort. The combined results suggested that a high ER stress-related risk score was associated with cell adhesion, gamma phagocytosis, cation transport, cell surface cell adhesion, KRAS signalling, CD4 T cells, M1 macrophages, naive B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and eosinophils and less benefitted from ICI therapy. Based on the expression patterns of ER stress-related genes, we created an appropriate predictive model, which can also help distinguish the immune characteristics, CNV, methylation, and the clinical benefit of ICI therapy. KEY MESSAGES: Melanoma is the cutaneous tumor with a high degree of malignancy, the highest fatality rate, and extremely poor prognosis. Model usefulness should be considered when using models that contained more features. We constructed the Endoplasmic Reticulum stress-associated signature using TCGA and GEO database based on machine learning algorithm. ER stress-associated signature has excellent ability for predicting prognosis for melanoma.

      Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is one of the fastest developing malignancies with strong aggressive ability and no proper curative treatments. Numerous studies illustrated the importance of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification to tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to identify novel prognostic signature by using m6A-related lncRNAs, thus to improve the survival for SKCM patients and guide SKCM therapy.

Pearson correlation analysis was performed to assess the correlations between lncRNAs and 29 m6A-related genes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to construct m6A-related lncRNAs prognostic signature (m6A-LPS). The accuracy and prognostic value of this signature were validated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis, univariate COX or multivariate COX analyses. After calculating risk scores, patients were divided into low- and high-risk subgroups by the median value of risk scores.

The m6A-LPS was validated using K-M and ROC analysis and the predictive accuracy of the risk score was also high according to the AUC of the ROC curve in training and testing sets. A nomogram based on tumor stage, gender and risk score that had a strong ability to forecast the 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-year OS of SKCM patients confirmed by calibrations.

      The molecular mechanisms underlying melanoma metastasis remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to delineate the mechanisms underlying gene expression alterations during metastatic potential acquisition and characterize the metastatic subclones within primary cell lines. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of a poorly metastatic melanoma cell line (WM239A) and its subclones with high metastatic potential to the lung (113/6-4L) and the brain (131/4-5B1 and 131/4-5B2). Unsupervised clustering of 8173 melanoma cells identified three distinct clusters according to cell type ('Primary', 'Lung' and 'Brain' clusters) with differential expression of MITF and AXL pathways and putative cancer and cell cycle drivers, with the lung cluster expressing intermediate but distinct gene profiles between primary and brain clusters. Principal component (PC) analysis revealed that PC2 (the second PC), which was positively associated with MITF expression and negatively with AXL pathways, primarily segregated cell types, in addition to PC1 of the cell cycle pathway. Pseudotime trajectory and RNA velocity analyses suggested the existence of cellular subsets with metastatic potential in the Primary cluster and an association between PC2 signature alteration and metastasis potential acquisition. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas melanoma samples by clustering into PC2-high and -low clusters by quartiles of PC2 signature expression revealed that the PC2-high cluster was an independent significant factor for poor prognosis (p-value = 0.003) with distinct genomic and transcriptomic characteristics, compared to the PC2-low cluster. In conclusion, we identified signatures of melanoma metastasis with prognostic significance and putative pro-metastatic subclones within a primary cell line.

      Immunotherapy for neuroblastoma remains unsatisfactory due to heterogeneity and weak immunogenicity. Exploring powerful signatures for the evaluation of immunotherapy outcomes remain the primary purpose. We constructed a ferroptosis-related gene (FRG) signature by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and Cox regression, identified 10 independent prognostic FRGs in a training cohort (GSE62564), and then verified them in an external validation cohort (TCGA). Associated with clinical factors, the signature accurately predicts overall survival of 3, 5, and 10 years. An independent prognostic nomogram, which included FRG risk, age, stage of the International Neuroblastoma Staging System, and an MYCN status, was constructed. The area under the curves showed satisfactory prognostic predicting performance. Through bulk RNA-seq and proteomics data, we revealed the relationship between hub genes and the key onco-promoter MYCN gene and then validated the results in MYCN-amplified and MYCN-non-amplified cell lines with qRT-PCR. The FRG signature significantly divided patients into high- and low-risk groups, and the differentially expressed genes between the two groups were enriched in immune actions, autophagy, and carcinogenesis behaviors. The low-risk group embodied higher positive immune component infiltration and a higher expression of immune checkpoints with a more favorable immune cytolytic activity (CYT). We verified the predictive power of this signature with data from melanoma patients undergoing immunotherapy, and the predictive power was satisfactory. Gene mutations were closely related to the signature and prognosis. AURKA and PRKAA2 were revealed to be nodal hub FRGs in the signature, and both were shown to have significantly different expressions between the INSS stage IV and other stages after immunohistochemical validation. With single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we found that genes related to T cells were enriched in TNFA signaling and interferon-γ hallmark. In conclusion, we constructed a ferroptosis-related gene signature that can predict the outcomes and work in evaluating the effects of immunotherapy.

          Objective:
        
      
      As one of the most lethal and aggressive cutaneous malignancies, cutaneous melanoma (CM) greatly threatens human health and has long challenged clinicians because of its poor therapeutic response. Anoikis is a newly discovered form of apoptosis that was originally identified in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent studies have reported that anoikis is central to cancer metastasis. The aim of this study is to explore the role of anoikis-associated genes in CM.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We identified hub anoikis-associated genes in CM and constructed a risk signature for patients with CM. Gene expression from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to screen hub anoikis-associated genes connected with CM, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset was applied to externally validate the identified genes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), differential expression, univariate Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses were used to identify hub genes. Immune cell infiltration in CM was also evaluated to explore the association between hub genes and immune heterogeneity. Finally, an anoikis-associated prognostic model was constructed.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Following complex analysis, FASLG, SOD2, BST2, PIK3R2, IKZF3, CDK2, and RAC3 were identified as hub anoikis-associated genes. Indeed, Kaplan-Meier and receiver operating characteristic analyses suggested that the expression patterns of hub genes can be used as prognostic factors for CM survival. The expression and survival trends of hub genes were verified in the validation cohort. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that the number of immune cells varied among patients with CM and identified seven genes. Furthermore, functional analyses indicated that the constructed risk signature was significantly associated with patient survival, age, and tumor growth and could also serve as an independent prognostic factor for patients with CM.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      We suggest that the hub genes FASLG, SOD2, BST2, PIK3R2, IKZF3, CDK2, and RAC3 are involved in the anoikis-associated signature. The pattern of hub anoikis-associated genes may have a prognostic potential for CM progression and overall patient survival."

          Background:
        
      
      Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is the deadliest dermatology tumor. Ongoing researches have confirmed that the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) family are crucial in driving carcinogenesis. However, the function of NLRs signaling pathway-related genes in SKCM remains unclear.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Objective:
        
      
      To establish and identify an NLRs-related prognostic signature and to explore its predictive power for heterogeneous immune response in SKCM patients.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      Establishment of the predictive signature using the NLRs-related genes by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-Cox regression analysis (LASSO-COX algorithm). Through univariate and multivariate COX analyses, NLRs signature's independent predictive effectiveness was proven. CIBERSORT examined the comparative infiltration ratios of 22 distinct types of immune cells. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry implemented expression validation for critical NLRs-related prognostic genes in clinical samples.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      The prognostic signature, including 7 genes, was obtained by the LASSO-Cox algorithm. In TCGA and validation cohorts, SKCM patients with higher risk scores had remarkably poorer overall survival. The independent predictive role of this signature was confirmed by multivariate Cox analysis. Additionally, a graphic nomogram demonstrated that the risk score of the NLRs signature has high predictive accuracy. SKCM patients in the low-risk group revealed a distinct immune microenvironment characterized by the significantly activated inflammatory response, interferon-α/γ response, and complement pathways. Indeed, several anti-tumor immune cell types were significantly accumulated in the low-risk group, including M1 macrophage, CD8 T cell, and activated NK cell. It is worth noting that our NLRs prognostic signature could serve as one of the promising biomarkers for predicting response rates to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Furthermore, the results of expression validation (RT-qPCR and IHC) were consistent with the previous analysis.

      A promising NLRs signature with excellent predictive efficacy for SKCM was developed.

      Background: Uveal Melanoma (UM) is the most prevalent primary intraocular malignancy in adults. This study assessed the importance of chromatin regulators (CRs) in UM and developed a model to predict UM prognosis. Methods: Gene expression data and clinical information for UM were obtained from public databases. Samples were typed according to the gene expression of CRs associated with UM prognosis. The prognostic key genes were further screened by the protein interaction network, and the risk model was to predict UM prognosis using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and performed a test of the risk mode. In addition, we performed gene set variation analysis, tumor microenvironment, and tumor immune analysis between subtypes and risk groups to explore the mechanisms influencing the development of UM. Results: We constructed a signature model consisting of three CRs (RUVBL1, SIRT3, and SMARCD3), which was shown to be accurate, and valid for predicting prognostic outcomes in UM. Higher immune cell infiltration in poor prognostic subtypes and risk groups. The Tumor immune analysis and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score provided a basis for clinical immunotherapy in UM. Conclusion: The risk model has prognostic value for UM survival and provides new insights into the treatment of UM.

      In this study, the clinical implications and potential functions of necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) in melanoma were systematically characterized. A novel NRG signature was then constructed to analyze the immune status and prognosis of patients with melanoma. The NRG signatures for melanoma prognosis were searched using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and followed by stepwise Cox regression analysis. Patients with melanoma were divided into two groups, and survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and univariate and multivariate analyses were subsequently performed. The correlation of risk score (RS) with tumor immunity and RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was analyzed to further verify the gene signatures. Data on tumor mutational burden (TMB) and chromosomal copy number variation (CNV) were analyzed. Three NRGs were identified as prognostic risk signatures and were significantly related to overall survival (OS) in melanoma. The signatures had better diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, analysis of mutations in the NRGs and the incidence of chromosomal CNV helped to reveal the relationship between mutations and melanoma occurrence. A nomogram was established based on RSs. The risk characteristics were significantly associated with immunity and high risk is closely correlated with melanoma development. In vitro experiments revealed that necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) promoted cell viability and repressed the expression levels of interleukin (IL)12A and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type (PCSK)1. Additionally, the expression levels of IL12A, CXCL10, and PCSK1 decreased in tumor tissues of melanoma patients. NRGs exert vital roles in immunity and might be applied as a prognostic factor of melanoma.

          Background:
        
      
      New immunotherapeutic strategies based on predictors are urgently needed. Toll-like receptor adaptor interacting with SLC15A4 on the lysosome (TASL) was recently confirmed to fulfill an important role in the innate immune response. However, whether TASL is involved in tumor development and immunotherapy response prediction has not been reported.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      TCGA and GTEx were used to yield transcriptional, genetic, and epigenetic levels of TASL in 33 cancer types. CIBERSORT was used to explore the correlation between TASL expression and multiple immune-related signatures and tumor-infiltrating immune cell content in different cancer types. The ability of TASL to predict tumor immunotherapy response was analyzed in seven datasets. Finally, we tested TASL expression in human glioma cell lines and tissue samples and analyzed its correlation with clinicopathological parameters.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      TASL is widely heterogeneous at the transcriptional, genetic, and epigenetic levels. High TASL expression is an independent poor prognostic factor for immune \"cold\" tumor Low-Grade Glioma (LGG) but an opposite factor for \"hot\" tumors Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM). TASL may affect tumor immune infiltration by mediating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-associated macrophages. It may differentially affect the prognosis of the three cancers by regulating the immunosuppressive microenvironment in LGG and the immunostimulatory microenvironment in LUAD and SKCM. High TASL expression is a potential biomarker for the positive response to immunotherapy in cancers such as SKCM and was also experimentally confirmed to be positively associated with adverse clinicopathological features of gliomas.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusion:
        
      
      TASL expression is an independent prognostic factor for LGG, LUAD, and SKCM. High TASL expression is a potential biomarker for the positive response to immunotherapy in certain cancer types such as SKCM. Further basic studies focusing on TASL expression and tumor immunotherapy are urgently needed.

      We performed a pan-cancer analysis of over 8,000 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Machine learning methods were employed to systematically explore the relationship between mutational signatures and TME and develop a risk score based on TME-associated mutational signatures to predict patient survival outcomes. We also constructed an interaction model to explore how mutational signatures and TME interact and influence cancer prognosis.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Our analysis revealed a varied association between mutational signatures and TME, with the Clock-like signature showing the most widespread influence. Risk scores based on mutational signatures mainly induced by Clock-like and AID/APOBEC activity exhibited strong pan-cancer survival stratification ability. We also propose a novel approach to predict transcriptome decomposed infiltration levels using genome-derived mutational signatures as an alternative approach for exploring TME cell types when transcriptome data are unavailable. Our comprehensive analysis revealed that certain mutational signatures and their interaction with immune cells significantly impact clinical outcomes in particular cancer types. For instance, T cell infiltration levels only served as a prognostic biomarker in melanoma patients with high ultraviolet radiation exposure, breast cancer patients with high homologous recombination deficiency signature, and lung adenocarcinoma patients with high tobacco-associated mutational signature.

      Our study comprehensively explains the complex interplay between mutational signatures and immune infiltration in cancer. The results highlight the importance of considering both mutational signatures and immune phenotypes in cancer research and their significant implications for developing personalized cancer treatments and more effective immunotherapy.

      Deep learning has been extensively used in digital histopathology. The purpose of this study was to test deep learning (DL) algorithms for predicting the vital status of whole-slide image (WSI) of uveal melanoma (UM).
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      We developed a deep learning model (Google-net) to predict the vital status of UM patients from histopathological images in TCGA-UVM cohort and validated it in an internal cohort. The histopathological DL features extracted from the model and then were applied to classify UM patients into two subtypes. The differences between two subtypes in clinical outcomes, tumor mutation, and microenvironment, and probability of drug therapeutic response were investigated further.

      We observed that the developed DL model can achieve a high accuracy of > = 90% for patches and WSIs prediction. Using 14 histopathological DL features, we successfully classified UM patients into Cluster1 and Cluster2 subtypes. Compared to Cluster2, patients in the Cluster1 subtype have a poor survival outcome, increased expression levels of immune-checkpoint genes, higher immune-infiltration of CD8 + T cell and CD4 + T cells, and more sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy. Besides, we established and verified prognostic histopathological DL-signature and gene-signature which outperformed the traditional clinical features. Finally, a well-performed nomogram combining the DL-signature and gene-signature was constructed to predict the mortality of UM patients.

We found out two subgroups based on histopathological DL features, which may in favor of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Finally, a well-performing nomogram that combines DL-signature and gene-signature was constructed to give a more straightforward and reliable prognosis for UM patients in treatment and management.

          Methods:
        
      
      RNA sequencing data of 4 immunotherapy-treated melanoma datasets and TCGA melanoma was obtained from open access repository. Differential expression analysis and pathway analysis were performed between immunotherapy responders and non-responders. Using dataset GSE91061 as the training group, a multivariate logistic regression model was built from estrogen response-related differential expression genes to predict the response to immunotherapy. The other 3 datasets of immunotherapy-treated melanoma were used as the validation group. The correlation was also examined between the prediction score from the model and immune cell infiltration estimated by xCell in the immunotherapy-treated and TCGA melanoma cases.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      \"Hallmark Estrogen Response Late\" was significantly downregulated in immunotherapy responders. 11 estrogen response-related genes were significantly differentially expressed between immunotherapy responders and non-responders, and were included in the multivariate logistic regression model. The AUC was 0.888 in the training group and 0.654-0.720 in the validation group. A higher 11-gene signature score was significantly correlated to increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells (rho=0.32, p=0.02). TCGA melanoma with a high signature score showed a significantly higher proportion of immune-enriched/fibrotic and immune-enriched/non-fibrotic microenvironment subtypes (p<0.001)-subtypes with better response to immunotherapy-and significantly better progression-free interval (p=0.021).
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this study, we identified and verified an 11-gene signature that could predict response to immunotherapy in melanoma and was correlated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Our study suggests targeting estrogen-related pathways may serve as a combination strategy for immunotherapy in melanoma.

          Background:
        
      
      Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is one of the malignant tumors with a relative high lethality. Necroptosis is a novel programmed cell death that participates in anti-tumor immunity and tumor prognosis. Necroptosis has been found to play an important role in tumors like CM. However, the necroptosis-associated lncRNAs' potential prognostic value in CM has not been identified.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      The RNA sequencing data collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) was utilized to identify differentially expressed genes in CM. By using the univariate Cox regression analysis and machine learning LASSO algorithm, a prognostic risk model had been built depending on 5 necroptosis-associated lncRNAs and was verified by internal validation. The performance of this prognostic model was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic curves. A nomogram was constructed and verified by calibration. Furthermore, we also performed sub-group K-M analysis to explore the 5 lncRNAs' expression in different clinical stages. Function enrichment had been analyzed by GSEA and ssGSEA. In addition, qRT-PCR was performed to verify the five lncRNAs' expression level in CM cell line (A2058 and A375) and normal keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT).

      We constructed a prognostic model based on five necroptosis-associated lncRNAs (AC245041.1, LINC00665, AC018553.1, LINC01871, and AC107464.3) and divided patients into high-risk group and low-risk group depending on risk scores. A predictive nomogram had been built to be a prognostic indicator to clinical factors. Functional enrichment analysis showed that immune functions had more relationship and immune checkpoints were more activated in low-risk group than that in high-risk group. Thus, the low-risk group would have a more sensitive response to immunotherapy.

      Anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by cell detachment, plays a key role in cancer metastasis. However, the potential roles of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in assessing the prognosis of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unclear.

      We screened 100 anoikis-related differentially expressed genes between SKCM tissues and normal skin tissues, which could divide all patients into three different subtypes with significantly distinct prognosis and immune cell infiltration. Then, an anoikis-related signature was developed based on subtype-related DEGs, which could classify all SKCM patients into low and high ARG_score groups with differing overall survival (OS) rates. ARG_score was confirmed to be a strong independent prognostic indicator for SKCM patients. By combining ARG_score with clinicopathological features, a nomogram was constructed, which could accurately predict the individual OS of patients with SKCM. Moreover, low ARG_score patients presented with higher levels of immune cell infiltration, TME score, higher tumor mutation burden, and better immunotherapy responses.

      Platelets play a vital role in cancer and immunity. However, few comprehensive studies have been conducted on the role of platelet-related signaling pathways in various cancers and their responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. In the present study, we focused on the glycoprotein VI-mediated platelet activation (GMPA) signaling pathway and comprehensively evaluated its roles in 19 types of cancers listed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Cox regression and meta-analyses showed that for all 19 types of cancers, patients with high GMPA scores tended to have a good prognosis. Furthermore, the GMPA signature score could serve as an independent prognostic factor for patients with skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). The GMPA signature was linked to tumor immunity in all 19 types of cancers, and was correlated with SKCM tumor histology. Compared to other signature scores, the GMPA signature scores for on-treatment samples were more robust predictors of the response to anti-PD-1 blockade in metastatic melanoma. Moreover, the GMPA signature scores were significantly negatively correlated with EMMPRIN (CD147) and positively correlated with CD40LG expression at the transcriptomic level in most cancer patient samples from the TCGA cohort and on-treatment samples from anti-PD1 therapy cohorts. The results of this study provide an important theoretical basis for the use of GMPA signatures, as well as GPVI-EMMPRIN and GPVI-CD40LG pathways, to predict the responses of cancer patients to various types of ICB therapy.

          Background:
        
      
      It is now understood that the effectiveness of checkpoint immunotherapy can be impaired by immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Nonetheless, the impact of different TAM subpopulations on the antitumor immune response remains unclear, mainly due to their heterogeneity. Herein, we identified a novel TAM subpopulation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) that might contribute to poor clinical outcomes and immunotherapy modulation.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods and results:
        
      
      We analyzed two single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets (GSE145370 and GSE160269) of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to identify a novel TREM2-positive TAM subpopulation characterized by upregulation of TREM2, C1QC, C1QB, C1QA, SPP1, and APOE. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated that these genes were significantly overexpressed in ESCC. Multiplex immunofluorescence validated the infiltration of TREM2+ TAMs in ESCC tissues, which correlated with poorer overall survival (OS). The scRNA-seq analysis in dataset GSE120575 indicated significant enrichment of TREM2+ TAMs in melanoma patients (n=48) with poor immunotherapy response, which had an identical gene signature with TREM2+ TAMs from ESCC. Analysis of 29 bulk-RNA melanoma samples from dataset GSE78220 revealed that a gene signature of 40 genes associated with TREM2+ TAMs was upregulated in the transcriptome of melanomas that did not respond to anti-PD1 therapy. Validation in the TCGA ESCC cohort (n=80) showed that a high enrichment score of the TREM2+ TAM was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, 10 ESCC patients treated with anti-PD1 therapy suggested that patients who are not sensitive to immunotherapy have higher density of TREM2+TAMs infiltration.

      Chromosomal instability (CIN) is closely associated to the early detection of several clinical tumours. In this study, the authors first established a novel prognostic model of melanoma using the hub genes of CIN, based on the datasets of The cancer genome atlas-skin cutaneous melanoma (TCGA-SKCM) and GSE65904 cohorts. Based on the risk scores of our model, the disease-specific survival (DSS) prognosis was worse in the high-risk group. Combining risk score, stage, age, ulceration, and clark factors, a Nomogram was generated to predict 1, 3, 5-year survival rates, which indicated a good clinical validity. Our finding also showed a correlation between high/low risk and tumour infiltration levels of 'activated CD8 T cells' and 'effector memory CD8 T cells'. Moreover, the authors first performed a CIN-based tumour clustering analysis using TCGA-SKCM cases, and identified two melanoma clusters, which exhibit the distinct DSS prognosis and the tumour-infiltrating levels of CD8 T cells. Taken together, a promising CIN-related prognostic signature and clustering for melanoma cases were first established in our study.

      The tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamically regulates cancer progression and affects clinical outcomes. This study aimed to identify molecular subtypes and construct a prognostic risk model based on TME-related signatures in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) patients. We categorized SKCM patients based on transcriptome data of SKCM from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and 29 TME-related gene signatures. Differentially expressed genes were identified using univariate Cox regression and Lasso regression analysis, which were used for risk model construction. The robustness of this model was validated in independent external cohorts. Genetic landscape alterations, immune characteristics, and responsiveness to immunotherapy/chemotherapy were evaluated. Three TME-related subtypes were identified, and subtype C3 exhibited the most favorable prognosis, had enriched immune-related pathways, and possessed more infiltration of T_cells_CD8, T_cells_CD4_memory_activated, and Macrophages_M1 but a lower TumorPurity, whereas Macrophages_M2 were increased in subtype C1 and subtype C2. Subtype C1 was more sensitive to Cisplatin, subtype C2 was more sensitive to Temozolomide, and subtype C3 was more sensitive to Paclitaxel; 8 TME-related genes (NOTCH3, HEYL, ZNF703, ABCC2, PAEP, CCL8, HAPLN3, and HPDL) were screened for risk model construction. High-risk patients had dismal prognosis with good prediction performance. Moreover, low-risk patients were more sensitive to Paclitaxel and Temozolomide, whereas high-risk patients were more sensitive to Cisplatin. This risk model had robustness in predicting prognosis in SKCM patients. The results facilitate the understanding of TME-related genes in SKCM and provide a TME-related genes-based predictive model in prognosis and direction of personalized options for SKCM patients.

      Ferroptosis, a recently uncovered iron-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death process, has been increasingly linked to cancer development. In this study, our objective was to develop a prognostic model centered on ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) and assess its efficacy as an overall survival (OS) prediction biomarker. We conducted a systematic analysis of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and devised a novel ferroptosis-related prognostic signature (FRGSig) using the TCGA database. An independent dataset from GSE65904 was employed to corroborate the validity of the FRGSig. Both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were utilized to construct a FRGSig composed of five FRGs. mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis demonstrated that the expression of FRGSig genes varied between tumor and normal tissues. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with elevated FRGsig scores faced a worse prognosis. The predictive accuracy of FRGSig was evaluated using the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), with the area under the curve (AUC) values for 1, 3, and 5 OS at 0.682, 0.711, 0.735 in the TCGA cohort, and 0.662, 0.695, 0.712 in the validation dataset, respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that FRGSig served as an independent prognostic factor. Further analysis revealed a significant relationship between FRGSig and Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) as well as immune infiltration levels. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) disclosed functional disparities between high- and low-risk groups, suggesting that immune checkpoint-related pathways could be instrumental in the improved prognosis of the low-risk group. Taken together, the FRGSig has potential guidance for prognosis prediction and clinical treatment of CM.

          Background:
        
      
      In recent years, there has been growing evidence indicating a relationship between liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and cancer development. However, to date, the clinical significance of LLPS in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM, hereafter referred to as melanoma) remains to be elucidated. In the current study, the impact of LLPS-related genes on melanoma prognosis has been explored.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      LLPS-related genes were retrieved from the DrLLPS database. The prognostic feature for LLPS in melanoma was developed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and verified in the GSE65904 cohort. Based on risk scores, melanoma patients were categorized into high- and low-risk groups. Thereafter, the differences in clinicopathological correlation, functional enrichment, immune landscape, tumor mutational burden, and impact of immunotherapy between the two groups were investigated. Finally, the role of key gene TROAP in melanoma was validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      The LLPS-related gene signature was developed based on MLKL, PARVA, PKP1, PSME1, RNF114, and TROAP. The risk score was a crucial independent prognostic factor for melanoma and patients with high-risk scores were related to a worse prognosis. Approximately, all immune-relevant characteristics, such as immune cell infiltration and immune scores, were extremely evident in patients with low-risk scores. The findings from the in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that the viability, proliferation, and invasion ability of melanoma cells were drastically decreased after the knockdown of TROAP.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our gene signature can independently predict the survival of melanoma patients. It provides a basis for the exploration of the relationship between LLPS and melanoma and can offer a fresh perspective on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

      Immune Checkpoint Therapies (ICT) have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients reaches complete responses. Deficient β2-microglobulin (β2M) expression impacts antigen presentation to T cells, leading to ICT resistance. Here, we investigate alternative β2M-correlated biomarkers that associate with ICT resistance. We shortlisted immune biomarkers interacting with human β2M using the STRING database. Next, we profiled the transcriptomic expression of these biomarkers in association with clinical and survival outcomes in the melanoma GDC-TCGA-SKCM dataset and a collection of publicly available metastatic melanoma cohorts treated with ICT (anti-PD1). Epigenetic control of identified biomarkers was interrogated using the Illumina Human Methylation 450 dataset from the melanoma GDC-TCGA-SKCM study. We show that β2M associates with CD1d, CD1b, and FCGRT at the protein level. Co-expression and correlation profile of B2M with CD1D, CD1B, and FCGRT dissociates in melanoma patients following B2M expression loss. Lower CD1D expression is typically found in patients with poor survival outcomes from the GDC-TCGA-SKCM dataset, in patients not responding to anti-PD1 immunotherapies, and in a resistant anti-PD1 pre-clinical model. Immune cell abundance study reveals that B2M and CD1D are both enriched in tumor cells and dendritic cells from patients responding to anti-PD1 immunotherapies. These patients also show increased levels of natural killer T (NKT) cell signatures in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Methylation reactions in the TME of melanoma impact the expression of B2M and SPI1, which controls CD1D expression. These findings suggest that epigenetic changes in the TME of melanoma may impact β2M and CD1d-mediated functions, such as antigen presentation for T cells and NKT cells. Our hypothesis is grounded in comprehensive bioinformatic analyses of a large transcriptomic dataset from four clinical cohorts and mouse models. It will benefit from further development using well-established functional immune assays to support understanding the molecular processes leading to epigenetic control of β2M and CD1d. This research line may lead to the rational development of new combinatorial treatments for metastatic melanoma patients that poorly respond to ICT.

      Antitumor mechanisms of CD4+ T cells remain crudely defined, and means to effectively harness CD4+ T-cell help for cancer immunotherapy are lacking. Pre-existing memory CD4+ T cells hold potential to be leveraged for this purpose. Moreover, the role of pre-existing immunity in virotherapy, particularly recombinant poliovirus immunotherapy where childhood polio vaccine specific immunity is ubiquitous, remains unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that childhood vaccine-specific memory T cells mediate antitumor immunotherapy and contribute to the antitumor efficacy of polio virotherapy.

      The impact of polio immunization on polio virotherapy, and the antitumor effects of polio and tetanus recall were tested in syngeneic murine melanoma and breast cancer models. CD8+ T-cell and B-cell knockout, CD4+ T-cell depletion, CD4+ T-cell adoptive transfer, CD40L blockade, assessments of antitumor T-cell immunity, and eosinophil depletion defined antitumor mechanisms of recall antigens. Pan-cancer transcriptome data sets and polio virotherapy clinical trial correlates were used to assess the relevance of these findings in humans.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Prior vaccination against poliovirus substantially bolstered the antitumor efficacy of polio virotherapy in mice, and intratumor recall of poliovirus or tetanus immunity delayed tumor growth. Intratumor recall antigens augmented antitumor T-cell function, caused marked tumor infiltration of type 2 innate lymphoid cells and eosinophils, and decreased proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Antitumor effects of recall antigens were mediated by CD4+ T cells, limited by B cells, independent of CD40L, and dependent on eosinophils and CD8+ T cells. An inverse relationship between eosinophil and Treg signatures was observed across The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer types, and eosinophil depletion prevented Treg reductions after polio recall. Pretreatment polio neutralizing antibody titers were higher in patients living longer, and eosinophil levels increased in the majority of patients, after polio virotherapy.

      Pre-existing anti-polio immunity contributes to the antitumor efficacy of polio virotherapy. This work defines cancer immunotherapy potential of childhood vaccines, reveals their utility to engage CD4+ T-cell help for antitumor CD8+ T cells, and implicates eosinophils as antitumor effectors of CD4+ T cells.

      Uveal melanoma (UM), the most frequent primary intraocular tumor in adults, has poor prognosis. High C-C motif chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) has been detected in various tumors and is closely correlated with patients' clinicopathological characteristics. However, the essential role of CCL18 in UM remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the prognostic value of CCL18 in UM. Uveal melanoma cells (M17) were transfected with pcDNA3.1-CCL18 si-RNA using Lipofectamine™ 2000. Cell growth and invasion abilities were measured through Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and invasion assay. RNA expression data and clinical and histopathological details were downloaded from the UM in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-UM) and GSE22138 datasets, which were defined as the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify significant prognostic biomarkers. The coefficients of these significant biomarkers generated by multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were used to establish a risk score formula. Functional enrichment analyses were also carried out. We found that downregulated CCL18 inhibits M17 cell growth and invasion in vitro. CCL18 may affect UM progression by altering C-C motif receptor 8 related pathways. Higher CCL18 expression was associated with worse clinical outcomes and tumor-specific death in the TCGA-UM dataset. Based on the coefficients obtained from the Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, a CCL18-related prognostic signature formula was constructed as follows: risk score = 0.05590 × age +2.43437 × chromosome 3 status +0.39496 × ExpressionCCL18. Notably, in this formula, the normal chromosome 3 was coded as 0, whereas the chromosome 3 loss was coded as 1. Each patient was assigned to either low-risk or high-risk groups using the median cut-off in the training cohort. High-risk patients survived for a shorter time than low-risk patients. The time-dependent and multivariate receiver operating characteristic curves showed promising diagnostic efficacy. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated the potential of this CCL18-related signature as an independent prognostic indicator. These results were validated using the GSE22138 dataset. In addition, in both TCGA-UM and GSE22138 datasets, stratification of clinical correlations and survival analyses based on this signature indicated the involvement of clinical progression and survival outcome in UM. In the high-risk group, Gene Ontology analyses mainly indicated the enrichment of immune response pathways, such as the T cell activation, response to interferon-gamma, antigen processing and presentation, interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway, MHC protein complex, MHC class II protein complex, antigen binding, and cytokine binding. Meanwhile, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses showed enrichments of pathways in cancer, cell adhesion, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, and chemokine signaling pathway. Moreover, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated the enrichment of almost all immune cells and immune functions in the high-risk group. In summary, a new prognostic CCL18-related signature was successfully established using the TCGA-UM dataset and validated using the GSE22138 dataset with meaningful predictive and diagnostic efficacies. This signature could serve as an independent and promising prognostic biomarker for patients with UM.

      Ferroptosis, a form of cell death caused by iron-dependent peroxidation of lipids, plays an important role in cancer. Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the regulation of ferroptosis in tumor cells and are also closely related to tumor immunity. Immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment affects the prognosis and clinical outcome of immunotherapy in melanoma patients, and immune cell classification may be able to accurately predict the prognosis of melanoma patients. However, the prognostic value of ferroptosis-related lncRNAs (FRLs) in melanoma has not been thoroughly explored, and it is difficult to define the immune characteristics of melanoma. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, and the FerrDb database to identify FRLs. FRLs with prognostic value were evaluated in an experimental cohort utilizing univariate, LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and multivariate Cox regression, followed by in vitro assays evaluating the expression levels and the biological functions of three candidate FRLs. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to assess the validity of the risk model, and the drug sensitivity of FRLs was examined by drug sensitivity analysis. The differentially expressed genes between the high- and low-risk groups in the risk model were enriched in the immune pathway, and we further found immune gene signatures (IRGs) that could predict the prognosis of melanoma patients through a series of methods including single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA). Finally, two GEO cohorts were used to validate the predictive accuracy and reliability of these two signature models. Our findings suggest that FRLs and IRGs have the potential to predict the prognosis of patients with cutaneous melanoma.

      The neural crest (NC) is highly multipotent and generates diverse lineages in the developing embryo. However, spatiotemporally distinct NC populations display differences in fate potential, such as increased gliogenic and parasympathetic potential from later migrating, nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors (SCPs). Interestingly, while melanogenic potential is shared by both early migrating NC and SCPs, differences in melanocyte identity resulting from differentiation through these temporally distinct progenitors have not been determined. Here, we leverage a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) model of NC temporal patterning to comprehensively characterize human NC heterogeneity, fate bias, and lineage development. We captured the transition of NC differentiation between temporally and transcriptionally distinct melanogenic progenitors and identified modules of candidate transcription factor and signaling activity associated with this transition. For the first time, we established a protocol for the directed differentiation of melanocytes from hPSCs through a SCP intermediate, termed trajectory 2 (T2) melanocytes. Leveraging an existing protocol for differentiating early NC-derived melanocytes, termed trajectory 1 (T1), we performed the first comprehensive comparison of transcriptional and functional differences between these distinct melanocyte populations, revealing differences in pigmentation and unique expression of transcription factors, ligands, receptors and surface markers. We found a significant link between the T2 melanocyte transcriptional signature and decreased survival in melanoma patients in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). We performed an in vivo CRISPRi screen of T1 and T2 melanocyte signature genes in a human melanoma cell line and discovered several T2-specific markers that promote lung metastasis in mice. We further demonstrated that one of these factors, SNRPB, regulates the splicing of transcripts involved in metastasis relevant functions such as migration, cell adhesion and proliferation. Overall, this study identifies distinct developmental trajectories as a source of diversity in melanocytes and implicates the unique molecular signature of SCP-derived melanocytes in metastatic melanoma."

      Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has been recognized as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response in cancer. Systematic identification of molecular features correlated with TMB is significant, although such investigation remains insufficient.

      We analyzed associations of somatic mutations, pathways, protein expression, microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) antitumor immune signatures, and clinical features with TMB in various cancers using multi-omics datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program and datasets for cancer cohorts receiving the immune checkpoint blockade therapy.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Among the 32 TCGA cancer types, melanoma harbored the highest percentage of high-TMB (≥ 10/Mb) cancers (49.4%), followed by lung adenocarcinoma (36.9%) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (28.1%). Three hundred seventy-six genes had significant correlations of their mutations with increased TMB in various cancers, including 11 genes (ARID1A, ARID1B, BRIP1, NOTCH2, NOTCH4, EPHA5, ROS1, FAT1, SPEN, NSD1,and PTPRT) with the characteristic of their mutations associated with a favorable response to immunotherapy. Based on the mutation profiles in three genes (ROS1, SPEN, and PTPRT), we defined the TMB prognostic score that could predict cancer survival prognosis in the immunotherapy setting but not in the non-immunotherapy setting. It suggests that the TMB prognostic score's ability to predict cancer prognosis is associated with the positive correlation between immunotherapy response and TMB. Nine cancer-associated pathways correlated positively with TMB in various cancers, including nucleotide excision repair, DNA replication, homologous recombination, base excision repair, mismatch repair, cell cycle, spliceosome, proteasome, and RNA degradation. In contrast, seven pathways correlated inversely with TMB in multiple cancers, including Wnt, Hedgehog, PI3K-AKT, MAPK, neurotrophin, axon guidance, and pathways in cancer. High-TMB cancers displayed higher levels of antitumor immune signatures and PD-L1 expression than low-TMB cancers in diverse cancers. The association between TMB and survival prognosis was positive in bladder, gastric, and endometrial cancers and negative in liver and head and neck cancers. TMB also showed significant associations with age, gender, height, weight, smoking, and race in certain cohorts.

      The molecular and clinical features significantly associated with TMB could be valuable predictors for TMB and immunotherapy response and therefore have potential clinical values for cancer management.

          Background:
        
      
      Melanoma is among the most malignant immunologic tumor types and is associated with high mortality. However, a considerable number of melanoma patients cannot benefit from immunotherapy owing to individual differences. This study attempts to build a novel prediction model of melanoma that fully considers individual differences in the tumor microenvironment.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      An immune-related risk score (IRRS) was constructed based on cutaneous melanoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to calculate immune enrichment scores of 28 immune cell signatures. We performed pairwise comparisons to obtain scores for cell pairs based on the difference in the abundance of immune cells within each sample. The resulting cell pair scores, in the form of a matrix of relative values of immune cells, formed the core of the IRRS.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      The area under the curve (AUC) for the IRRS was over 0.700, and when the IRRS was combined with clinical information, the AUC reached 0.785, 0.817, and 0.801 for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, respectively. Differentially expressed genes between the two groups were enriched in staphylococcal infection and estrogen metabolism pathway. The low IRRS group showed a better immunotherapeutic response and exhibited more neoantigens, richer T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor diversity, and higher tumor mutation burden.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusion:
        
      
      The IRRS enables a good prediction of prognosis and immunotherapy effect, based on the difference in the relative abundance of different types of infiltrating immune cells, and could provide support for further research in melanoma.

          Introduction:
        
      
      As the most common aggressive intraocular cancer in adults, uveal melanoma (UVM) threatens the survival and vision of many people. Glycolysis is a novel hallmark of cancer, but the role of glycolysis-related genes in UVM prognosis remains unknown. The purpose of the study was to establish a glycolysis-related gene signature (GRGS) to predict UVM prognosis.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      Raw data were obtained from TCGA-UVM and GSE22138 datasets. The GRGS was established by univariate, LASSO, and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Kaplan-Meier survival and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the predictive ability of the GRGS. The relationships of the GRGS with infiltrating immune cell levels and mutations were analyzed with CIBERSORT and maftools.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      A novel GRGS (risk score = 0.690861*ISG20 + 0.070991*MET - 0.227520*SDC2 + 0.690223*FBP1 + 0.048008*CLN6 - 0.128520*SDC3) was developed for predicting UVM prognosis. The GRGS had robust predictive stability in UVM. Enrichment annotation suggested that the high-risk group had stronger adaptive immune responses and that the low-risk group had more innate immune cell infiltration. Moreover, BAP1 mutation was related to high risk, and SF3B1 mutation was related to low risk.

      This study developed and validated a novel GRGS to predict UVM prognosis and immune infiltration. The signature revealed an association between glycolysis-related genes and the tumor microenvironment, providing new insights into the role of glycolysis in UVM.

          Purpose:
        
      
      Due to poor prognosis and immunotherapy failure of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), this study sought to find necroptosis-related biomarkers to predict prognosis and improve the situation with predicted immunotherapy drugs.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Experimental design:
        
      
      The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Genotype-Tissue Expression Program (GTEx) database were utilized to recognize the differential necroptosis-related genes (NRGs). Univariate Cox (uni-Cox) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox analysis were utilized for prognostic signature establishment. The signature was verified in the internal cohort. To assess the signature's prediction performance, the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analyses, multivariate Cox (multi-Cox) regression, nomogram, and calibration curves were performed. The molecular and immunological aspects were also reviewed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Cluster analysis was performed to identify the different types of SKCM. Finally, the expression of the signature gene was verified by immunohistochemical staining.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      On basis of the 67 NRGs, 4 necroptosis-related genes (FASLG, PLK1, EGFR, and TNFRSF21) were constructed to predict SKCM prognosis. The area's 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS under the AUC curve was 0.673, 0.649, and 0.677, respectively. High-risk individuals had significantly lower overall survival (OS) compared to low-risk patients. Immunological status and tumor cell infiltration in high-risk groups were significantly lower, indicating an immune system that was suppressed. In addition, hot and cold tumors could be obtained by cluster analysis, which is helpful for accurate treatment. Cluster 1 was considered a hot tumor and more susceptible to immunotherapy. Immunohistochemical results were consistent with positive and negative regulation of coefficients in signature.

      The results of this finding supported that NRGs could predict prognosis and help make a distinction between the cold and hot tumors for improving personalized therapy for SKCM.

      Metastatic uveal melanoma remains incurable at present. We previously demonstrated that loss of BAP1 gene expression in tumour cells triggers molecular mechanisms of immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (TME) of metastatic uveal melanoma. Adipophilin is a structural protein of lipid droplets involved in fat storage within mammalian cells, and its expression has been identified in uveal melanoma. We comprehensively evaluated adipophilin expression at the RNA (PLIN2) and protein levels of 80 patients of the GDC-TCGA-UM study and in a local cohort of 43 primary uveal melanoma samples respectively. PLIN2 expression is a survival prognosticator biomarker in uveal melanoma. Loss of adipophilin expression is significantly associated with monosomy 3 status and nuclear BAP1 losses in uveal melanoma tumours. Integrative transcriptomic and secretome studies show a relationship between transient loss of adipophilin expression and increased levels of tumour-associated macrophages and hypoxia genes, suggesting PLIN2-dependent changes in oxygen and lipid metabolism in the TME of low and high-metastatic risk uveal melanoma. We designed four adipophilin-based multigene signatures for uveal melanoma prognostication using a transcriptomic and secretome survival-functional network approach. Adipophilin-based multigene signatures were validated in BAP1-positive and BAP1-negative uveal melanoma cell lines using a next-generation RNA sequencing approach. We identified existing small molecules, mostly adrenergic, retinoid, and glucocorticoid receptor agonists, MEK, and RAF inhibitors, with the potential to reverse this multigene signature expression in uveal melanoma. Some of these molecules were able to impact tumour cell viability, and carvedilol, an adrenergic receptor antagonist, restored PLIN2 levels, mimicking the expression of normoxia/lipid storage signatures and reversing the expression of hypoxia/lipolysis signatures in co-cultures of uveal melanoma cells with human macrophages. These findings open up a new research line for understanding the lipid metabolic regulation of immune responses, with implications for therapeutic innovation in uveal melanoma. © 2023 The Authors.

          Background:
        
      
      Melanoma is a common and aggressive cutaneous malignancy characterized by poor prognosis and a high fatality rate. Recently, due to the application of Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in melanoma treatment, melanoma patients' prognosis has been tremendously improved. However, the treatment effect varies quite differently from patient to patient. In this study, we aim to construct and validate a Cuproptosis-related risk model to improve outcome prediction of ICIs in melanoma and divide patients into subtypes with different Cuproptosis-related genes.

      Here, according to differentially expressed genes from four melanoma datasets in GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), and one in TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database, a novel signature was developed through LASSO and Cox regression analysis. We used 781 melanoma samples to examine the molecular subtypes associated with Cuproptosis-related genes and studied the related gene mutation and TME cell infiltration. Patients with melanoma can be divided into at least three subtypes based on gene expression profile. Survival pan-cancer analysis was also conducted for melanoma patients.

          Background:
        
      
      Pyroptosis is closely related to the programmed death of cancer cells as well as the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) via the host-tumor crosstalk. However, the role of pyroptosis-related genes as prognosis and TIME-related biomarkers in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) patients remains unknown.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      We evaluated the expression profiles, copy number variations, and somatic mutations (CNVs) of 27 genes obtained from MSigDB database regulating pyroptosis among TCGA-SKCM patients. Thereafter, we conducted single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) for evaluating pyroptosis-associated expression patterns among cases and for exploring the associations with clinicopathological factors and prognostic outcome. In addition, a prognostic pyroptosis-related signature (PPRS) model was constructed by performing Cox regression, weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis to score SKCM patients. On the other hand, we plotted the ROC and survival curves for model evaluation and verified the robustness of the model through external test sets (GSE22153, GSE54467, and GSE65904). Meanwhile, we examined the relations of clinical characteristics, oncogene mutations, biological processes (BPs), tumor stemness, immune infiltration degrees, immune checkpoints (ICs), and treatment response with PPRS via multiple methods, including immunophenoscore (IPS) analysis, gene set variation analysis (GSVA), ESTIMATE, and CIBERSORT. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating PPRS and clinical characteristics to improve risk evaluation of SKCM.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Many pyroptosis-regulated genes showed abnormal expression within SKCM. TP53, TP63, IL1B, IL18, IRF2, CASP5, CHMP4C, CHMP7, CASP1, and GSDME were detected with somatic mutations, among which, a majority displayed CNVs at high frequencies. Pyroptosis-associated profiles established based on pyroptosis-regulated genes showed markedly negative relation to low stage and superior prognostic outcome. Blue module was found to be highly positively correlated with pyroptosis. Later, this study established PPRS based on the expression of 8 PAGs (namely, GBP2, HPDL, FCGR2A, IFITM1, HAPLN3, CCL8, TRIM34, and GRIPAP1), which was highly associated with OS, oncogene mutations, tumor stemness, immune infiltration degrees, IC levels, treatment responses, and multiple biological processes (including cell cycle and immunoinflammatory response) in training and test set samples.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      Based on our observations, analyzing modification patterns associated with pyroptosis among diverse cancer samples via PPRS is important, which can provide more insights into TIME infiltration features and facilitate immunotherapeutic development as well as prognosis prediction."

      Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, single-sample gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) and hierarchical clustering analysis were performed to identify the immune infiltration pattern of UVM and classify patients into two immunity clusters. Then, we proposed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify immune-related genes that related to overall survival (OS) and validated in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) external validation cohort. The molecular and immune classification in the immune-related gene prognostic signature defined subgroups were analyzed.

      The immune-related gene prognostic signature was constructed based on S100A13, MMP9, and SEMA3B genes. The prognostic value of this risk model was validated in three bulk RNA sequencing datasets and one single-cell sequencing dataset. Patients in the low-risk group had better OS than those in the high-risk group. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed its strong predictive ability for UVM patients. Lower expression of immune checkpoint genes was presented in the low-risk group. Functional studies showed that S100A13 knockdown via siRNA inhibited UVM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, with the increased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) related markers in UVM cell lines.

      The immune-related gene prognostic signature is an independent predictive factor for the survival of patients with UVM and provides new information about cancer immunotherapy in UVM.

          Background:
        
      
      Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) play a crucial role in anti-cancer immunity. Progression of CTL to terminal exhausted T lymphocytes (ETL) that overexpress inhibitory receptors can substantially decrease effector cytokines production and diminish cytolytic activity and terminal exhausted T cell cannot be reprogrammed by ICIs in tumor microenvironment (TME). However, while the activity levels of CTL and ETL are considered important determinants of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) response, it has been repeatedly observed that their predictive power of the latter is quite limited. Studying this conundrum on a large scale across the TCGA cohort, we find that ETL and CTL activity (estimated based on conventional gene signatures in the bulk tumor expression) is strongly positively correlated in most cancer types. We hypothesized that the limited predictive power of CTL activity might result from the high concordance of CTL and ETL activities, which mutually cancels out their individual antagonistic effects on ICI response.

      Consequently, we have set out to identify a set of genes whose expression identifies a subset of patients where the CTL and ETL correlation is diminished, such that the association between these CD8+ T cell states and ICIs response is enhanced.

Reassuringly, we first find that the correlation between ETL and CTL activities is indeed markedly lower across high scoring DS patients than that observed across low scoring DS patients in numerous independent melanoma ICIs cohorts. Second, indeed, this successful decoupling increases the power of CTL activity in predicting ICIs response in high DS scoring patients. We show that the resulting prediction accuracy is superior to other state-of-art ICI predictive transcriptomic signatures.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusion:
        
      
      The new decoupling score boosts the power of CTL activity in predicting ICIs response in melanoma from the tumor bulk expression. Its use enables a two-step stratification approach, where the response of high scoring DS patient can be predicted more accurately that with extant transcriptomic signatures.

      The significance of inflammation in tumorigenesis and progression has become prominent. This study aimed to construct and validate the molecular subtype and a novel prognostic signature based on inflammatory response-related genes in uveal melanoma (UM). Patients from the TCGA, GSE84976, and GSE22138 UM cohorts were enrolled. According to the consensus cluster analysis, patients were divided into two molecular subtypes, namely IC1 and IC2. Survival curves showed that patients in IC1 had a better prognosis. The IC2 subgroup had higher levels of immune cell infiltration and more enriched immunological pathways. There were statistical differences in the immune-inflammation microenvironment, immune checkpoint genes expression, and drug sensitivity. The prognostic signature constructed based on inflammatory response-related genes exhibited a stable predictive power. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the signature was a prognostic factor independent of clinical characteristics. Functional analyses showed that the high-risk group was associated with immunological response, inflammatory cell activation, and tumor-related signal pathways. The riskscore had a negative relationship with tumor purity and was positively correlated with immune and stromal scores. Furthermore, the prognostic signature could sensitively predict the response to drug treatments. In conclusion, the prognostic signature might aid in stratifying patients at risk premised on the prognosis and immunotherapy sensitivity.

      Immunotherapy is a vital treatment for patients with cutaneous melanoma (CM), but effective predictors to guide clinical immunotherapy are lacking. Cuproptosis is a newly discovered mode of cell death related to tumorigenesis. Exploring the relationship between the mode of cuproptosis and the effect of immunotherapy on CM could better guide clinical management. We clustered all patients with CM in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database based on cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs). Prognosis, immunotherapeutic effect, tumor microenvironment score, expression of CD274, CTLA4, and PDCD1, and abundance of CD8 + T infiltration in group A were higher than in group B. Using a combination of LASSO and COX regression analysis, we identified 10 molecules significant to prognosis from differentially expressed genes between the two groups and constructed a cuproptosis-related scoring system (CRSS). Compared with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, CRSS more accurately stratified CM patient risk and guided immunotherapy. CRSS successfully stratified risk and predicted the effect of immunotherapy in 869 patients with eight CM immunotherapy datasets and multiple other tumor immunotherapy cohorts. The nomogram model, which combined AJCC stage and CRSS, greatly improved the ability and accuracy of prognosis prediction. In general, our cuproptosis-related scoring system and nomogram model accurately stratified risk in CM patients and effectively predicted prognosis and the effect of immunotherapy in CM patients.

      Resistance to cancer immunotherapy continues to impair common clinical benefit. Here, we use whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 knockout data to uncover an important role for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2) in determining tumor susceptibility to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing in human melanoma cells. TSC2-depleted tumor cells had disrupted mTOR regulation following CTL attack, which was associated with enhanced cell death. Wild-type tumor cells adapted to CTL attack by shifting their mTOR signaling balance toward increased mTORC2 activity, circumventing apoptosis, and necroptosis. TSC2 ablation strongly augmented tumor cell sensitivity to CTL attack in vitro and in vivo, suggesting one of its functions is to critically protect tumor cells. Mechanistically, TSC2 inactivation caused elevation of TRAIL receptor expression, cooperating with mTORC1-S6 signaling to induce tumor cell death. Clinically, we found a negative correlation between TSC2 expression and TRAIL signaling in TCGA patient cohorts. Moreover, a lower TSC2 immune response signature was observed in melanomas from patients responding to immune checkpoint blockade. Our study uncovers a pivotal role for TSC2 in the cancer immune response by governing crosstalk between TSC2-mTOR and TRAIL signaling, aiding future therapeutic exploration of this pathway in immuno-oncology.

      Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death that can activate adaptive immune response, and its ability to reshape the tumor microenvironment via multiple mechanisms may contribute to immunotherapy. The treatment options for patients with skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) vary based on BRAF V600E statuses. However, all standard treatments include immunotherapy. Therefore, it is critical to identify ICD-associated signatures that can help classify patients according to benefits from ICD immunotherapy. In this study, data on melanoma samples with BRAF V600E mutation (BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma) and melanoma samples with wild-type BRAF V600E alleles (BRAF V600E WT melanoma) were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The ICD-related (ICD-high and ICD-low) subgroups of patients with BRAF V600E WT melanoma were established via consensus clustering. The analyses of survival, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional annotation, and immune landscape were performed in these two subgroups. Results showed that ICD-high subgroup was correlated with a positive overall survival (OS) and active tumor immune landscape. A model comprising seven prognosis ICD-related gene biomarkers was developed. Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluation in both cohorts with BRAF V600E WT and BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma showed an accurate prognostic estimation of ICD-related risk signature. There was a correlation between immune cell infiltration and immunotherapy response and risk score. Thus, the ICD risk signature was closely associated with the tumor's immune microenvironment. Our results may provide insights to further individualize and improve precision therapeutic decision-making in BRAF V600E-mutant and WT melanoma."

      Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is the skin cancer that causes the highest number of deaths worldwide. There is growing evidence that the tumour immune microenvironment is associated with cancer prognosis, however, there is little research on the role of immune status in melanoma prognosis. In this study, data on patients with Skin cutaneous melanoma were downloaded from the GEO, TCGA, and GTEx databases. Genes associated with the immune pathway were screened from published papers and lncRNAs associated with them were identified. We performed immune microenvironment and functional enrichment analyses. The analysis was followed by applying univariate/multivariate Cox regression algorithms to finally identify three lncRNAs associated with the immune pathway for the construction of prognostic prediction models (CXCL10, RXRG, and SCG2). This stepwise downscaling method, which finally screens out prognostic factors and key genes and then uses them to build a risk model, has excellent predictive power. According to analyses of the model's reliability, it was able to differentiate the prognostic value and continued existence of Skin cutaneous melanoma patient populations more effectively. This study is an analysis of the immune pathway that leads lncRNAs in Skin cutaneous melanoma in an effort to open up new treatment avenues for Skin cutaneous melanoma.

      Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRNs) expression and their critical role in various types of cancer have been reported. However, it is still unclear which CHRNs and their associated genes play essential roles in metastasis in melanoma patients. Here, we performed bioinformatics analyses on publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of patients with melanoma to identify the CHRNs highly expressed in metastatic melanoma. We found that CHRNA1 was highly expressed in metastatic melanoma samples compared to primary melanoma samples and was strongly associated with CHRNB1 and CHRNG. These muscle-type CHRNs (CHRNA1, CHRNB1, and CHRNG) were correlated with the ZEB1 and Rho/ROCK pathway-related genes in metastatic melanoma samples. Pairwise correlations and enrichment analyses revealed that CHRNA1 was significantly associated with myogenesis/muscle contraction and cell cycle genes. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrated the involvement of CHRNA1, four of its correlated genes (DES, FLNC, CDK1, and CDC20), and the myogenesis gene signature in the prognosis of melanoma patients. Following the bulk RNA-seq analysis, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis showed that the CHRNA1-expressing melanoma cells are primarily metastatic and had high expression levels of CHRNB1, CHRNG, and myogenesis/cell cycle-related genes. Our bioinformatics analyses of the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data of patients with melanoma revealed that CHRNA1 and its correlated myogenesis/cell-related cycle genes are critical prognosis-related markers of metastatic melanoma.

      Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is the most malignant skin tumor for it is enormously easy to develop invasion and metastasis. Autophagy is a process by which cellular material is degraded by lysosomes or vacuoles and recycled. Autophagy-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been thought to correlate with SKCM. This study aims to explore the prognostic significance of autophagy-related lncRNAs and establish a prognostic model of autophagy-related lncRNA pairs in SKCM. Firstly, the RNA-seq data and related clinical information were downloaded from the TCGA database. 446 qualified samples were enrolled. 222 autophagy-related genes were obtained from the HADb database. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to identify autophagy-related lncRNAs (ARLs). After that, we obtained prognosis-related ARLs and autophagy-related lncRNA pairs (ARLPs). Using Lasso-Cox regression analysis, an autophagy-related lncRNA-pair prognostic signature was established. The accuracy of the signature were confirmed through a series of validations in terms of mutation profiles, immunity infiltration, and cellular pathways. And we used the random forest method to find USP30-AS1 as a key mediating factor in SKCM.

      Immunotherapy based on anti-PD1 antibodies has improved the outcome of advanced melanoma. However, prediction of response to immunotherapy remains an unmet need in the field. Tumor PD-L1 expression, mutational burden, gene profiles and microbiome profiles have been proposed as potential markers but are not used in clinical practice. Probabilistic graphical models and classificatory algorithms were used to classify melanoma tumor samples from a TCGA cohort. A cohort of patients with advanced melanoma treated with PD-1 inhibitors was also analyzed. We established that gene expression data can be grouped in two different layers of information: immune and molecular. In the TCGA, the molecular classification provided information on processes such as epidermis development and keratinization, melanogenesis, and extracellular space and membrane. The immune layer classification was able to distinguish between responders and non-responders to immunotherapy in an independent series of patients with advanced melanoma treated with PD-1 inhibitors. We established that the immune information is independent than molecular features of the tumors in melanoma TCGA cohort, and an immune classification of these tumors was established. This immune classification was capable to determine what patients are going to respond to immunotherapy in a new cohort of patients with advanced melanoma treated with PD-1 inhibitors Therefore, this immune signature could be useful to the clinicians to identify those patients who will respond to immunotherapy.

      We successfully constructed the CD8 + MeTIL signature based on four DMPs. The survival analyses showed that higher CD8 + MeTIL score was associated with worse survival outcomes in TCGA-SKCM and GSE144487 cohorts. The ROC curve for the predictive analysis revealed that the survival prediction of CD8 + MeTIL score was superior compared with CD8 + TILs (CIBERSORT) and CD8B mRNA expression. Furthermore, we founded that tumors with higher CD8 + MeTIL score were marked with immunosuppressive characteristics, including low immune score and downregulated immune-related pathways. More importantly, the CD8 + MeTIL score showed a potential predictive value for the benefit from immunotherapy in two published cohorts. When combined CD8 + MeTIL with PD-L1 expression, the patient classification showed significantly different immunotherapy response rates and long-term survival outcomes.

      Integration of high-dimensional tumor gene expression data with clinicopathological data can increase our understanding of disease diversity, enable retrospective patient stratification, and identify new potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Using a systems biology approach, we provide a holistic overview of gene co-expression networks in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis of HNSCC RNA sequencing data from 519 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to determine correlates of 5-year survival, using regression tree-based optimal threshold calculations. Survival-associated gene sets were transformed to gene set scores that were assessed for correlation with clinicopathological data. We identified 8 gene co-expression modules for HNSCC tumors, each of which contained co-expressed genes associated significantly with 5-year survival. Survival-associated co-expression gene signatures correlated dominantly with tumor HPV and p16 status. Network analysis identified that survival was associated with signaling networks of infection, immunity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, glycolysis, focal adhesion, extracellular matrix, MYC signaling, autophagy and transcriptional regulation. EMT-associated gene signatures were expressed dominantly in fibroblasts, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were inversely correlated with immune activity. Interestingly, a high Immune Suppression Score based on expression of 21 genes associated with immune inhibition and including immune checkpoints, cytokines and regulatory T cell factors, was also associated with increased survival probability, and was significantly higher in HPV+ HNSCC. Networks associated with HNSCC survival were further associated with survival in cervical cancer, melanoma and lung cancer. This study defines 5129 genes associated with HNSCC survival, organized into co-expressed networks, their correlation with clinicopathological data, and with gene expression data from other malignant diseases, and provides a source for the discovery of biomarkers and novel therapies for HNSCC."

          Background:
        
      
      There exists a lack of effective tools predicting prognosis for cutaneous melanoma patients. Glycolysis plays an essential role in the carcinogenesis process.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Objective:
        
      
      We intended to construct a new prognosis model for cutaneous melanoma.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      Based on the data from the TCGA database, we conducted a univariate Cox regression analysis and identified prognostic glycolysis-related genes (GRGs). Meanwhile, the GSE15605 dataset was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The intersection of prognostic GRGs and DEGs was extracted for the subsequent multivariate Cox regression analysis.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      A prognostic signature containing ten GRGs was built, and the TCGA cohort was classified into high and low risk subgroups based on the risk score of each patient. K-M analysis manifested that the overall survival of the high-risk group was statistically worse than that of the lowrisk group. Further study indicated that the risk-score could be used as an independent prognostic factor that effectively predicted the clinical prognosis in patients of different ages, genders, and stages. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed DEGs between high and low risk groups were enriched in immune-related functions and pathways. In addition, a significant difference existed between high and low risk groups in infiltration pattern of immune cells and expression levels of inhibitory immune checkpoint genes.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusion:
        
      
      A new glycolysis-related gene signature was established for identifying cutaneous melanoma patients with poor prognoses and formulating individualized treatment.
